what day the ‘mountains first emerged srom the uatem, but
upon what day tlzcir tops were seen. We are insormcd indeed.
that “ In the Golst year, on the first day of the first mouth,
the waters were dried up from off the earth.‘’ But how was
this known? The sacred historian informs us——On that day
“ Noah removed the covc-ring of the ark, and look-cd, and
behold the face of the ground was dry.’' It is then recorded
upon the authority of Noah's observation.

Iwould remark another minute circumstance in this history,
which tends forcibly to the same point. The παίετε arc said
lo have prevailed 15 cubits upwarcls, and the mountaius erere
covered. Now mountains are so various in their height, that,
if by this passage we are simply to understand that tlzc zcal‘crs
were 15 cabits lciglzer than the momitains, it can mean nothing·
The waters must have been much deeper, over the mountains
of Ararat, before they could hade reached the top of the Alps.
And the mountain where the ark rested could not have been
an inaccessible peak; it must have afforded a practicable
descent sor man and beast.

But let us recollcct that the whole depth of the ark was 30
cubits. In order to give its motion a due stcadincss on the
flood, and at the same time, to afford a sufficient access of
air to the middle and lower story, through the window that
was in its side, we must suppose that, together with its freight,
it drew about 15 cubits, or half its own depth, of water. let
it was lifted up from the earth, it floated over the summits
ol' the hills, without touching them, till the seventh month3
when it indicated an abatem'ent of the waterS, by resting upon
a mountain of Ararat: and this happened upwards of two
months bcsorc the top of any other neighbouring mountain
was scen. 'l‘hesc circumstances must have been minutcly
obscrvcd by Noah, and from them, hc must have collected,
