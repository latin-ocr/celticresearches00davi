The epitome of primitive history, in the fourth chapter of
Genesis, informs 115 of several eminent men amonget th&
descendants of Adam, down to the flood, who discovered-
and improved upon the first principles of such aris and
sciences aspre conducive to the comfort and ornament of
society. Nor was this all that they did. The antediluvian
ages were evidently ages of application as well as of genius·
Μ611 did not accidentally strike upon some solitary discovery,
and contentthemselves with the fame they acquired in the
completion of it. They applied the principles of ‘ilie art al·-
seady known, as a clue for the discovery os other aits, with
. which it had a naturai connection.

Thus, the first inventor of stringed nisti-amenis kept. sight
of the general principles of music, and the scale of harmo-
nious sounds, till, by analogy, he had found ont the nature
of wind-instruments: ancl, by repeated efforts of genius, he
became tlte father of all saclc as handle the HARP and 5]ae
ORGAN.

The first artificer in brass pnrsned the same course, till he
had likewise developed the nature and proper management
of iron ore.

If we reste& that these men retained the vigorous. use of
their faculties for a space of six or seren centuries‚ to re-
peat their experiments, and to make continual improvement

. upon the useful hints which presented themselves, Ι think we
may conclude that they carried their inventions to a high
degree of perfection. And it was perhaps the wise desig-n of
Li’rovidenceto afford an opportunity for such improvement&
