Men disused the necessary paim, to put the organa
of speech into complete contaet, at the point qs ar·-
ticulataesson. Some portion of breath escaped‚ and vibrated
in the inter-sticc; a kind of secondary consonantS, or semi·
powers were produced. Thus P was reduced to ψ, or F; B
and M, to V,· T to Θ or Th,- D to Dl2,· Cto χ οι· Ch,

guttural, Sto.

These, which Ῑ would call seconclary consonants, may be
deemed of considerable antiquity. They are admitted, in
the utterance of the oldest languages that now remain,
if our mode of delivering them can be depended upon; but,
their introduction, must have been posterior to the inven-
tion of writing. In most of the old alphabets, we find, that
some, or all of them, want their appropriate characters.
Not one of them is acknowledged‚ amongst the sixteen
ancient letters of the Greeks ι-Θ, Φ, and X, are late addi-
tions, to the alphabet of that pcople.

As the Asiatics ‘took the lead, in the augmentation of
their alpliabet5‚ we find some of the secondary powerS, or
aspirath amongst the series of letters, in which the law
of Moses was written3 εις, 2, to, and ³3 but before the in-
troduction of pointS, they had no appropriate character

for the sound of F or Ph, Bk or V, Dlz, &a

Α If the M'asorctae mark their primitive mute, with a point,
and if they distinguish tiae aspirate, or secondary power,
by the simple character, this can prove nothing. The old
letters had no points at all. The new mode of discrimination
was arbitrary3 or, at best, could only resolveitself into the
taste of a corrupt age.
