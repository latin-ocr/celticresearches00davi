by which the learned understand, periods of time which he
had calculated. I find, by Philo ι1111116115, that the ancient
Mystagogues regarded 100 as a perse& number. As the parts
which composed a perfec} whole.- or as the number of units
which constituted a complete series. If we regard 100 parts
as equal to a complete diurnal revolution, then 36525 parts
will amount to 365 days and 6 hours: or if 100 years con-
stitute a perfect age, agreeably to Philo's application of 1116
number in the case of Abraham, then &6525 will be the
diurnal revolutions comprehended in that age. This lcon-
sider as a more simple method of accounting for the number
of the Herlnetic volumes, than by supposing a multiplication
of cycles, which must imply macla more than a true calcu-
lation of the solat period.

The Egyptians had μων-ς, as they are styled by the Greeks,
of 6, 4, or 3 Months. They may have divided the annual
Cir-cle into seasons, by insci-ibing some of their geometrical
figureS, as the line or the triangle, or else 1116 square,
touehing at the 4 cardinal points. 51111 1116 complete circle
remained the same. Is there nothing in the old testament to
confirm the antiquity of this computation and the use of 1116
Epagones? ι101) speaks (Chap. iii. 6.) of days joined to 1116
year, exclusive of the number of the months. The Epa-
gones appear then to have been known, out of Egjlpl‘, about
the time when Abraham settled in 1116 land οἱ Canaan, and
during the life of the great patri-archs. Let us consider Roah’s:
year. In the history of the deiuge we have 5 successivo
months consisting altogether of 150 days, or 530 days each.
Ι cannot conceive how such months could have been formed
upon any lunar observation. From the first day of the tenth
month, we have an enumeration of 61 days, together with
χ an unspecified period of time, before the connneneeinent ot*
the succeedlng year. A complete year in Noah’s days could
