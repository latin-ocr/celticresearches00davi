sin's device, of arming the symbolc'cczltrces, or letters, and
bringing them into the field of battle.

The Greeks have no tradition of any writings, known in
their country, anterior to those of leracian ,Bm-ds. To
tlcem, we ought, therefore, to ascribe the first publication
of the Pelasgida, and the Etruscan letters,—not their in-
vention,—but their introduction into popular use.

The names of these letters,—-—retained by the Romans,—
and their characters, copied from inscriptions, of uncertain
date, prove, indisputably, their common origin, with letters
of Britisk Bards. In No. VIII. of the annexed plate,
they are exhibited, at one view, together. The first line
is formed of Ba1·d27clots;—the second has been selected from
De Gebelin, and from Astlc’s Etruscan (zlplzabez‘s ;—a third,
from the inscriptions of the sepulchral grottos at Corneto,
as they were engraved for the Gentlcnmn's Blagazine of
June, 1779.

had been written, from right to left. The old Greeks, and
the Italiam, wrote both ways. .

It is now, perhaps, no. improper stage of the discussion, to
examine the origin, or solution of the testimony given us by
Xenophon, and by Archilochus, which has been cited by
Buclccr—viz. “ that the characters which Cadmus introduced
into Greece, were more similar to, the Gaalzfslt, than to
the Punic, or Pha-niciam l<·ttc1·s.''

From what has been stated, I assume it as a just infer-
enee, that ancient Getulis& characters, intimated by these
authors, were, in general, the same as the Bardic letters,
