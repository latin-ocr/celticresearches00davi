The· word gaydcl, when plural, signifies trees3 if singu-
lar, a suge, or philosopher.

From this passage, it becomes the main business of the
poem, 'though interspersed with mysterious hints, to describe
‘the allegory of arming the symbolical trees, or plants, and
bringing them out, in order of battle The device is not
without sublimity, though of rather awild and singular cast 3—-
but this poem is not the only piece, which touches upon
'the subject. .

There is an aenigmatica} account, of the same battle, in
the first volume of the Welslz A rclzaeology, P. 167, to which
I refer the Reader for the original: the following is a
literal translation.

“ The history of the battle of the trees.”—-

“ These are the versicles which were sung, at the battle
of the trees, or, as others call it, the battle of Aclm‘en, [Ι.
Graan, a tree; whence, cranclzar, a lot, or tokew, i. e. a
render tree, or 'sprigJ It happened, on account ofa white
froebuclc, and a wlzelp, which came from the lower region,
and were taken by Amatlza0n‚” [from Maria, kind, species,
and honi, to discrime‘natc’,] “ the son of D&n,” [genius]
‘⁶ For this reason, Amathaon, the son of D5n, engaged
with Arawnj' [cloquence, thefaculty (ᾖ ερεεσῘιᾹ “ king of
the lower region.''

“ And there was a man, in 'the battle, who could not be
conquered, till his name was known: and, on the other
side, thore was a woman, called Aclzren, [α’ τνεε,] whose
party could not be overcome, till her name was discovered.
