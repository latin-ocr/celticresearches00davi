Smer. III. Of the material accident-«5 and changes which

have affected elementary sounds, and characters, in pri-
mitive τεοναε.

BEFORE I attempt an explanation of the several names
of the letters, and consider the force of their several, and
respective, elementary sounds, in the formation of language,
I think it necessary to take some notice, of the more

general accidents, and changes in utterance, and in or·
thography.

In subjects that are so complex, exceptions, and ano-
malies must be supposed : but we may observe, in most of
the dialects, whilst undergoing the operation of culture,
and refinement, a general progreSS, from simplicity of
temus, to artfficial combination, and from strength, or
energy qf sounds, to delicmy, aud sqftncss. This progress
must have begun, long before the complete formation os
those languages, which come under our notice.

When men first communicated their thoughts to each
other, by such tones, ⁴and articulations, as were produced
naturally, and spontaneously, by their various perceptions,
and emotions‚ accompanied with strong gestureS, their
elementary sounds were probably few3 but they must have
bcen the most eiiergetic, and, therefore, the most perfect,
