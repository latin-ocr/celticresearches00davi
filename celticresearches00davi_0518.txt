In Ινίείι, Ι signifies, anat-t or scicnce—skill or knowledge,
that is appropriated and inherent, and applicable to its
proper pwpost’3 an island—that is, interval, or encom-
Jmssed (land); low, invem-d.

5. The same force of this power appears in the Greek ιω,
whence ιεω and ιημι, to send, to place ,- and in its derivative,
σος, a missile weapon, an arrozc, or a spear, which is directed
to a certain object. It seems to have the same meaning,
as a prefix3 35, ι-απτω, to send to, shoot ac, ι-αλλω, to send, to
aim at. But what more decidedly marks its force, in this
language, is the circumstance of its forming the termination
of the dative case singular, in all the various declensions of
substantii-es, adjectives‚ pronouns‚ and participles, of what-
ever gender: and its returning again, in the same case, in
sshe plural, either alone, or accompanied by the emphatic
ς, or ν. ΠἮΘΗ it is recollected‚ that the termination of
cases, were originally separable terms, importing relative
ideas, it must appear, that the framers of the Greek lan-
guage regarded I, in the same light that our Celtae did, as
implying an appropriation,applicatifflz, or directim, to a
certain object—into, t0,f01·, towards,pcrtaiuing to. The
preceding observation may bc emended to most of the
Latin declensions.

6. The symbol of Iwas the γεω trec, the peculiar use of
which, in the construction of the bow, sufficiently cha-
racterizes the force and the import. of this element. T he
name is Icllzo, perhaps from ld, direct, upriglzt,just-—
certainty and precision. ldla implies use, fruitiou, appro-
priation, and Idlzo, in lVelsh, to lzim, to or for it.
