to constitute the rudiments qf an alplzabet.

The main force of this objection may, however, he a

Celtic language, which are mentioned in Sect. ΙΙΙ. and
which, perhaps, characterized the original state of language

in general.

The radicals of this language are of the· simplest nature
imaginable. They consist either of single vowels, or of
single consonantS, connected with a vocal power.

Before the birth of compounds, and of derivatives‚ the
