“ Because, by sticlffi, the Druids divined.''
Borlase.

Whilst these Druids regarded the several sticks, or sprz'gs‚
as complete symbols, in themselves, it would have been
superfluous, to inscribe them with characters, which, at
most, could only have been of synonymous import.

It is probable, however, that sometimes the 0ch Celta:
dispensed with such an original primitive use of their lots,
and inscribed the symbolical characters, upon cuttings of
any one tree‚ as we find this habit prevalent in some of
the Germans, their neighbours, who also had their Barditus‚
Barddas‚ or Bardic institutions. Their manner of divining
by lots, is thus described by Tacitus, De moribus Germ,
and translated by Dr. Borlase .-

“ They cut a rod, or twig, taken from a fruitbearing
free, into little short sticks‚ or tallies; and, having distin-
guished them one from the other, by certain marks, lay
them, without any order, as they chance to fall, on a white
garment. Then comes thepriest of the state, if the con-
vsultation be at the request of the public, but if it be a matter
ofprivate curiosity, the master of the family may serve well
enough, and, having prayed to the gods, looking up to
heaven, he takes up each billet, or stick, three times, and
draws his interpretation from the marks before impressed on
them. If these marks intimate a prohibition to proceed‚
there is no further inquiry made that day concerning that
