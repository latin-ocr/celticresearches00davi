for so hidden was the subject, even to the generality of the
Greeks themselves, that we find those authors, who lnadc it
their business to elucidate mqthulogical narration, two thou-
sand years ago, perpetually amusing us with puerile con-
ceits. or shifting the solution with a commodioris pica of
sacred mystcries.

This darkness, and the uncertainty of poetica} reports, the
only ancient histories, which the Greek-s, and Romans pos-
sessed, induced their plez'losophers to reject it altogether, and
frame new them-ies of their own, upon the original statc of
mankind.

Amongst all the ancient pro-fessors of oracular wisdom,
none carried their speculations upon this topic, sofar, as that
sect, which denied the operation of the first intelligent cause,
and the superintending energies of a Divine Providence,--
ascribed the formation ofall things to a fortuitons concourse of
atonis, and consigned the govermnent of the world into the
hands ofchance. The most connected of the details, which
give us the opinions of the Epicurean-5, is contained in the
learned, butmost unphilosophical poem of Lucretius. From
this, we may gathcr, that in that peculias sect were 111611
of genius, and, could we bnt grant their fundamental prin-

ciples, men ofacute reasoning.

According to tlzcir hypothesis) the first men, that were
produced, were fit inhabitants of the world that existed ‘only
by accident. And they were above resting their specula-
tions upon imagination alone: it was their ambition‚ to
support them by (lata, when they could reach them, and
such, as could best accommodate their atheistical pre-
conceptionS.
