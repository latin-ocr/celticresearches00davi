They were surrounded by the works of nature, but with
none of them, could they have been further acquainted‚

intellectual powers enriched their capacity, their knowledge,
—as human beings, must bave been the child of experience,

The original speech of mankind must, therefore, have
been extremely simple. It must have been limited‚ exelu-
sively, to a few terms, and of these, to such as primarily
expressed the most obvious ideas, or sensations. Its words
must have been of the simplest kind.

Sounds naturally expressing ideas, men would first under-

artificial combinations.

The fundamental truth of this reasoning, is attested by the
original structure of all the languages that are known. All
the native terms of the most copious amongst them, may
be reduced, perhaps, to less than a thousand primitive
terms, of the most obvious import, and the simplest
form. The more ancient, and pure any language is,
the fewer, and the more simple are its primitiveS. It is
