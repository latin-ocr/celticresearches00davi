the relation, by which the object had presented itself to
the senscs.

From terms, descriptivc thus of leading ideas, the dis·
criminato classes of the words, in organized language,
would flow3 and without multiplying, or diversifying terms,
the acquisition of substantives, of adjectivcs, verbs, or
participles, would become naturally obvious.

The same descriptive term would suit its meaning to the
occasion, and would assume the character of a noun, or a
verb, as the circumstances would require.

For example, the simple articulation Κὲ, produced na-
turally, and spontaneously, by an effort, either to catch,
tom-le, or hold, would naturally describe an object, which had
been observed in these actions, and would thus become the
name of that which catches,—a dog ,- that which touchessm
a point,- or that which holds,—a cup. then spoken of
an object, it would as obviously signil'y, to catclrs—touclz,
‹nr—hold. It would again express the qualities of catch„
ing, tozcclez'ng, or holding; and, lastly‚ the abstract ideas
of a catch—*a tozcclz,——-·a hold.

So Ρέ, which is produced by an effort ofpztshing, or pro-2
truding, would naturally express, tlte pushmy—to pusb,-·
pzcslzing‚———protrusion. This mode of application would pr00
duce no embarrassment in thehearer. The English word,
sleot, in its various connections, is a substantive, an adjective,
a verb, and aparticiple : yet its meaning is always under·
stood. And, that such aleading proposition is true, in fact,
as wellas in theory, languages, as wc find them, after their
terms have been indefinite-ly diversified, by art, or tacit
agreement, furnish abundant proof. That Imay not collect
