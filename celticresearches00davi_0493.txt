of gesture, which require a perfect contact of the organs of
speech, at the point of articulation, and the energetic im·-
pulse of breath: But of these, one only can be ever pro-
duced, in any one part of the mouth. These were, there-
fore, primitives, necessarily.

P was a labial primitive ;—it was produced by a contact
of the lips, and a forcible impulse of breath.

T was a dental primitive, and formed by a contact of
the tip of the tongue, with the roots of the upper teeth.

S may be called sub-dentalj’ formed by the act of pressing
the lower teeth with the tip of the tongue, so forcibly,as to
bend its surface almost into contact with the upper gums.

‘L, pronounced as the Welslc LI, ma)v be named a gin-
gival. It is formed, by the act of placing the tongue evenly
against the upper gums, and forcing out breath on
both sides.

(Β, delivered as Greek ‘P, was a palatal primitive. It
is uttered, by fixing the sides of the tongue firmly against the
sides of the palate, and by impelling our breath so foreibly,
as to make the tip of the ton gue vibrate against the upper gums„

C, or K, was a guttural primitive, formed by the con-
tact of the tongue, and the root of the palate.

The vocal, and the articulate primitives, already men,
tioned, our first parents must have possessed, in the first*
years of their existence. Their natural efforts, to de-

scribe by gesture, would necessarily call them forth into
action.
