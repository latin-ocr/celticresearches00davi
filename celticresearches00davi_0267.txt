And he ask-ing {ftszere reas a man within, Collen replica,
“ I am3 who aslcs it ?''—-“ It is I, tlte messenger qf' quyrzj
the sonos Nudd, king oftlte lower regions, or of Annwn?

By this term, which denotes the deep, the low part, Ῑ
think the Celae, primarily understood a western situation,
towards which there was an app arent fall, in the course of
nature, and in this plimaiy sense, the term, Ithink‚ 111 {y
be understood m that remarkable viad, (No. V.)

WVhen the opinion first prevailed‚ that souls of men de·
scended for a time, to a lower state of existence, the west,
or low region was consecrated peculiarly to them,—
Ammm was applied figuratively to the condition of the
dead, or the infernal regions, which comprehended the
Elysium, and the Tartarus of antiquity. Thus we say,
“ Nid eir i Annwn ond unwaith.'' There will be bat οησ
Journey z‘o Hell. Cwn Annwn, are Hell-laounds. Plane
Annwn, the children of the deep, certain wandel-ing spirits⁶

As Annwn, or the west, was the peculiar land of the
dead, we find sepulchral monuments most frequent in the
western extremities of those countries, where Druidism was
professed‚ as in Britarqy, Cornwall, and [Uaria. There was
perhaps a time, when these Druias regarded I reland as the
land of spirits. The DIabiuogz'on, or irestitutiorzal tales,
represent Annwn as lying somewhere off Dyved, or Pem0
brokeslcir33 and the Irislz acknowledge Ammn, or Annua,
as an old name of their country. See Skaw, Llwyd, &a
