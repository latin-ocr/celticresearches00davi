APPENDIX.

I HAVE, in the pagos now closed, and at the mcrey of
the render, prompted some arguments in support of au
opinion, that, in realitj, and in fact, the celebrated IIyper·
borcans of antiquity were profess-ors of Dmidism, in its
earliest, and least-adulterated state. It must not, however,
be dissembled, that M. Malla, in his Northern Antiquities,
and that other very eminent writers have contemplated the

θ

subject in a different view.

They regard the character of Boreas, the father of the
Ilgsperborean priesfflood, as identified, i‘n the Bore of
Gothic mythology, ziiids'ron1 this position have argued,
that, in the Runic Edda, we discover the religious meets,
and system of those ,Bm-eadee. In addition to the reasons
which 1 have already given, for dissenting from that· hy-
pothesis, Ι beg leave to suggest the following remarks.

The Gothic system places the age of Bore at some·
remote period, before the creation of inan, or of the visible
world. His character has no analogy to that of Boreas,
who, together with his brethren, has been represented as
a dwarf, and the offspring of a comparatively recent

period.
