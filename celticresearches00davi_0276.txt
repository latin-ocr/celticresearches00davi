It appears, from several passages in Taliesin, that o'ur
Druids made use of stram-reeds, and the points, or- spicula
of certain trees, in all their sacred rites. Perhaps he alludes
to the Delion gffts, in telling us—

Bsun ynghaer Fesenydd. (L. Felcnydd.)
Yt gryssynt wellt α gwydd. W. Arclz. V. 1. p. 99.

“ I have been in the city of Belenydd, whither the strabos
and sprigs were hastening.'’

Pythagoras, whose philosophy bore a wonderful resem-
blance to that of Druids, is represented expressly to have
heard the Ganls and Braclmzans :5‘5 the former, as it should
seem, in the person of Alam-is, who delivered his arrow to
him, in other words, made a covenant with him, and at
the same time, instructed him in his doctrine. The philo·
>0phy 0¹f Greece, originated in the Celtae.†

The name of Abaris belongs to the Cymry. Assgos—
Κιμίξξοι, ως τινες φαςι, Κιμμεμι. δΐιῬΙι. Byzant. De Urb.

Abaris may have been one of the Abroi ; but the term
does not so properly appertain to the Notion, as to the reli-
gion of the Cymry. Abaruz} or Avarwnzs, the Contempla—
tive, is a familiar name in the old Wclsh. Abare's, consi-
dered as the character, Ι regard not as a personal name,
but as a description of the orde1·.÷-ln short, as I would un-
derstand BIagus, or Druida, I think a short summary of
Druidism‚ extracted from the institutional triads, of the
order in Britain, will justify this acceptation.
