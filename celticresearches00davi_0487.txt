from the rank of elements. But, it is probable‚ that, in the
infaney of language, the textzcul vowels, intended for cle-
scriptz'on, were generally uttered with strong aspiration.

This emergetic utterance has adhered so closely to the

introduc-tion of points, regarded them as consonants.

In Greek, the aspiration is the constant attendant of
the init1al Υ, and, frequently, of the other initial vowels.

From this general consent of old languageS, it may be
inserted, thatrnan's first efforts to express, by vocal signs,

were attended with strong, and soreible aspirationS.

These primary vowel-torres appear, from a comparison of
