So far, thc doctrine of Britae'slz Druids is exacth rc-

system, is completely ascertained, and preserved÷

Yet, there arc material circumstances, which point out a
very ancient, and remote period, for the separation of thc>e
alphabets from each other. The two series of characters
retain little, or no vestige of sinlilarity: and the Irish,
besides their cyphers, or secret alphabets, have three sets
of characters, the most modern of which are, nearly the
same as those on the grave—stone of Cadvan, prinee of
North lVales, who died about the year 616. Their order is
also totally different. The Irislz alphabet, begins with
B, L, N, the radica] consonants of Belin, the Apollo qf
the Celtae.

Rodericlc O’Flalzertgs, alearned [risle antiquary, of the.
seventeenth century, has collected, from some of the oldest
monuments of literature in his country, the ancient names
of the Irislz letters, together with an exact register of the
ι several trees, and plautS, from which they were deno-
minated.

These carious particulars, he has recorded in his Ogygia,
εἱυε rernm Hibernia-arum Chronologia .· and from this
author, Ed. leqyd transcribes thern, in their proper places,
in his Dictionary of the Irz'sh language. ¹
