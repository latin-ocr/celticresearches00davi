By neglecting to form thc orifice of the lips, with due'
rotundity.the power of O was reduced into an obscure sound,
like that of Ho, in leoney, or of O, in comc; consequent-

the Greeks, frequent occasion to confound it with 1.

and the single U of the Welsle.

Their best authors, at an age, in which oral delinquency
would have been intolerable, wrote Sulla, or Sylla, Lubet,
or Libet, Optumus, or Optimus, and umm, or imm, in
the termination of all superlatives. I, was the general
centre os the vowels, to which they all tended, when they
