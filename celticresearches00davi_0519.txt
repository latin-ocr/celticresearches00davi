“ Disdaining those who avoided him,
And transpiercing others,

When he made his inroad,

In the strife of the field,

ἶνας the ficrcely-impelling yew.'’

7. Iam-a, according to Hesych, implies a prominentpoiuae‘³
It may signify direction to α thing, from ιω to send: 01*
rather, admitting the general force of the element‚ let us
prefixit to ωὲεω, anciently, ωταω, and we shall have ιωταω, to
push forwards, to thrust into, exactly corresponding to the
Celtic idea, and almost a synonym of the Hebrew Ψ, or .··ι“ῐ’
Id, or Ide, to cast, or slcoot at. This verb also implies, to
punse, to love, to confes83 which have no other perceptible
affinity‚-with the former appropriations, than that they
denote actionS, peculiarly directed to ιι discriminate
olzject.

But we must regard Ψ, Id, a hand, as the Hebrew repreo
sentative of this power3 for, in the Etlciopic alphabet3 itis
called ω’, Imen, the right hand.

The force of ⁹, in the Hebrew l'anguage, may be inferred
from its use, in forming the future, or approaching tense of
all verbs—in forming appellative and proper names, where
it denotes the application or inherency of a certain quality—-=
in pointing out the effect, or consequence of the participle
active, when inserted after the first mdical, as from ΠΠ
