HAVING been guided thus far in my research, by in·-
ference from authorities, and facts, I may conclude that
anulogy between the sound and the sense, has not confined
itself to those terms, which are immediately connected with
names of the elementary powers; but was carried, accordae
ing to some general system, into the main body of pri-
mitive language3 from whence it has dcscended into the
several dialects, in which it can still be discovered, in some
degree, by a duc investigation of the system.

As the most obvious, and co'ncise method of ascertaining
the regular application of this principle,—I shall mark each
of the consonantS, connected successively with the several
vowelsg and then combine the force of the elements,
already developed, with all the simplicity, as wellas all the
accuracy, which the subject admits. To each of these
combinations‚ I shall add a few exmnples of simple, and
primitive terius, in those languages whichI compare, to-
gether with received approbations of each—I shall ul-
timately submit the consequence of this analysis to the
judgment of my readers.

The character, and the antiquity of the IIebrczo, entitle
that language to superior deferencc in such a comparison3
