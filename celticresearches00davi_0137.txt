In vain should our theorists appeal to the precedent and.
authority of history: for no such things as an equality of
conditions, and an avowed equality of rights, can be maced,
or even supposed to have existed in civil life. And even in thre
most savage nafions, where society is not connected by any
laws that extend beyond single families, excepting the law
of custom, it will be found that, in those famihoe, authority
and subordination are understood and admitted. T he same
distinction obtains in respe& of rights, The son who kills
the bear or the scal, has a right to feast with his father upon
the train3 but the indolent brother, who refuses tojoin in the
enterprize, has no claim to come in for his share of the
spoil.

This is exaffly analogous to the distinffion of rights, which
is acknowledged in society, and it points out a necessary
discrimination between social rightS, and those which are
properly natural. To those gifts which nature bestows in
common to all her children, they have an equal right, such
as breathing the vital air, secing the light of the sun, or
drinking of the current3 but of such things as are either
acquired or protected by social regulamus, society must have
a right to dispose‚ agreeably to its laws: And such laws
necessarily suppose authority, and consequently the duty of
submission3 permissioffi and consequently the power of
restraint3 relative 00113εᾶ11035, and therefore, relative
conditions.

It follows then that, ever since mankind began to iive in
society, authority and subordination, agreeably to some
certain mles, together with a variety of conditions, must have
existed in the world. And this has been, according to the
testimony of the sacred histor-ian, from the day upon which

God created man upon the carth,
