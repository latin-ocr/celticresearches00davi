ι and the Greek η, in composition3 μη, adv. prohibitory;
de,rc,sc, Sec. privative, or segregative particleS. E, in
Latin, is sometimes an intensive prefix3 as in c-durus;
but here, it must bc regarded as a mutation of A. Eu, in
Greek, has anomalous meanings; probably, because, in
the confusion of vowels, in that language, it is put for other
verbs: as, for Αω, to go on, to be, or continue, and for 10,
to send to, or place. Εω, may primarily have implied, to
move, remove, take.

The common, and, comparatively‚ modern G rech, often
substitutes ε οι· η, sor 'the α of the old Doric3 and, on the
contrary, a for the η of tlte Doric3 η or ε of the Iouic, and
tof the AEolic. The cause of this anomaly, was, that, in
the rapidity of utterance, α, ε, and η, were often reduced into
an obscure sound, which had no appropriate character, and
was, therefore, variously represented. However this may
have been, Ι think, general analogy will warrant the con-
clusion,that=the Greek α privative, was a substitution for
ε or η. The positive element a, still retains its intensive, or
augmentative force, as the initial of several words, and it is
not probable, that the same power was employed, originally,
to express ideas (liametrically opposite.

The same kin'd of substitution has gained admittanee in
the Welsh languagc, and, I think, for the same reason.
We now use the negative particles ml, (zm, av, (ln, for the
cd, cm, en, of our oldest manuscripts.

The'Lat. prep. a, ab, was probably Ap or amr, which is

best explained by the Celtic, ap-o, springing. from or
out qs.
