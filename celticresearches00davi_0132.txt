by the benthem, be regarded as so many primitive records,
adding mutual strength to each other, and refleeling mutual
light, in the same manner as the books of Kings and Chro-
nieles, and the narratives of the four Evangelists?

Is we duly consider the matter contained in the book of
Genesis, Ι think we shall be led to conclude that much of it
must necessarily have been collected from prior documenta
For example (Gen. xxii. ί30.) Abraham receives information
respeffing the family of his brother Nalior. No reason is
given why it was told Abraham: nor does any thing imme·
diately follow, as a consequence of such information. But as
the account related to Abraham's family, we are left to
conclude, that he recorded it; and, upon his authority, Moses
prescrves the record. He gives it not as a subject of revela-
latimi, nor as the result os his enquiry amongst the descendants
of Nalior, nor yet does he content himself with registering
the simple fact, buthe tells us what had been told Abraham at
suc-lt a time. At a distance of 400 yearS, he transcribes the
names of N ahoi-'s eight sons in due order, with some particular
circumstances respefting them, as it had been told Abraham,
and therefore, as it must have been recorded in some memo-⁷
rials in Abruliam's family. Moses must have possessed a very
exa& detail of the transaffions of Abraham’s time. Hence
the circumstantial account of the expedition of the four kings,
of that patriarch's treaties with the princes of the land in which
he sojourned, of his sacrifices, and of the promises he
received, and the allusion (Ex. xii.) to the year, the montlz, and
the rev-y day on which he began his peregrinationS.

In confirmation of the opinion advanced above, it may be
observed, that history furnishes no instance of an exa& chro-
nology having been preserved, for a series of ageS, by any
people who were totally illitcrate. Relative dates, and the
