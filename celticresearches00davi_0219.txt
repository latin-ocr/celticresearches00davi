111115. One branch of Togarmah's family seating itself on tho
banks of the Borysthenes (the nurse of Targstaus, 01· ΤΙ1Ο1-
Gut, their great ancestor) and beginning to possess the inter-
mediate region. ’-

The family of Ashlcena: did not find, in this neighbourhood,
that ample patrimon? which they could retain 111 peace, and
leave to their children for ever. Tlecir portion lay far to the
WYesn and the way, as yet, was open for them to go in search
of it. Part of them accordingly did set out upon that expe-
dition. After they had reached their destined acquisitionS,
they still retained their generic name, for Herodotus* places
thc Cynetae in the KVestern extremities of Europe, beyond the
Celtae. As the. Danube ri'ses in the country of the Celsa,
ulcu-ed by him, it 15 prob-able that he means t'ue Eastcrn Gaulo]
we must therefore look for 1115 Cynctce, ainongst the western
branches of the Celtae.

The name 15 acknowlcdged by the ancient Britons.

Ταῖἱεεὶιι, a hard of the 6111 century, 111 a poem which he
addresses to L‘rien, princ-e of Reged, calls 1115 countryinen
Cyn-wys, or Echen Gynwys--the nation of the Cyn—men:—
Cyn, in British, iinplying tlzefirst, the jbremost part, regularly
forms Cynet, for its plural, both in the Welsh and in the
Armoriean. It may be conti-acted fainiliarly to Cynt.

Aneurim, Taliesin's contemporary, in the conclusion os his
Gododin, distributes the Celtae of the British Islands into
“ Cym‘, a Gzcydclz’l a leyde'n.⁷' lee Cynt, the Irislz and
the North Rritons, making the Cym? or Cynet, the first of the
Celtic fainilics. Amongst our old British Kings we find
C ιψιιῖαυ, Cynctav, ἃς.
