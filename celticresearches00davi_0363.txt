curiosity. It contains thirty-six letters, sixteen of which,
are radical, and the rest, mutations of these.'’

“ It is singular, that the hardz‘c alphabet should contain,
all the Etruscan letters, without theqeast deviation of form,
except four 01· five of the latter, that are Roman.’'

It must be observed, that, for the purpose of convey-

In Fry’s Pantographia, P. 307, we have the following
account of the manner of using these characters, accom-
panied with a most curious, engraved, specimen. “ The ori-
ginal manner of writing, amongst the ancient Britons, was,

four, or three lines. (See Ezelc. xxxvii. 16.) The squares
were used for general subjects, and for stanzas, of four lines
in poetry: the trilateral ones were adapted to triades, and
