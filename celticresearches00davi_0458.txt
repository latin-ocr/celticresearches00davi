and from such rudiments, a language, of considerable
compass, would arise, in a few generations.

In such a tongue, mutual compact would obviously have
much· to tlo; but its ground-work would be laid, in the natu·
ral, and the untaught, principle, which disposes men, and
bmtes, to utter their voices, in certain tones, or modifica-
tions, analogous to their various perceptions, and emotions.

· The operation of this principle, upon the human voice,
may, at once, be perceived. ιῙοι , fear, pain, love, anger,
and all the passions, have their appropriate, and sponta-
neous tones, which are discriminately comprehended, not
only by persons of a different language, bur, in some de·
gree, by the intellect of brutes. Our (loge, and horch
know, by our tonos, whether we are angry, or satisfied,
menace, or applaucl,-cl1eck, or encourage them.

It will, perhaps, be concecled, that our spontaneous
tones are naturally expressive‚-—and that properties
of the vowels, are evidently connected with thern. But,
it will be urged, that no such impulse extends to the arti-
culation of the consonant. There are many, who will not
either (liscard, or abjure, the opinion, that every ncw articu-
lation is artificial, and of difficult acquisition.

To this oracle, Ithink, we may oppose an argument os
considerable weight, as drawn from the general perception
of an affinhy, between one sound, and one senso, in com-
positions, both ancient, and modern.

In all ages, and countries, men of an accurate car, and a ἢ
