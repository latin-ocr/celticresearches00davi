their first progenitors—to administer justice—to superintend
the due execution of the Laws—to encourage virtue and
punish vice—to inculcute religious and moral preccpts—-to

various productions. Their conceptions were great and
sublime, their speculations comprehensive in their spherey
pervading most of the arts and sciences which had interestcd
the earliest periods. Perhaps there was no order of men
amongst the heathenS, who preserved the history and the
opinions of mankind, in its early State? with more simplicity'2
and with more integi-ity.

The religion of the patriam-hs had, indeed, been deformed
with various superstitious, by all nations. But this order,
notwithstanding their many and gross errors, appear to have
retained many of its vital and essential principles.
