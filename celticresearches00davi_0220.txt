From the descendants then of Ashlcenaz, in my opinion,
sprung the original Celtae of the Π ἀεί, who ειυς-1011111ν possessed*
the whole of Gaul, the Islands of Britain, parc of Germany,

andert of Spain.

But a considerable body of this people did not leave their
Eastern possessions in peace. After the removal os the
C entimani, these remains of the Celtae were distinguished by
the name of Titum. They had perhaps been joined by the
real Titanian Cdtae, C'elto-S‹ytl2ce, or those branchos of the
Celtic family 11110 had assisted in building the tower of Babel,
and had been conrpclled, at the dispersim), to follow their
brethren. They seem to have mustered a sormidablc power
against those who deeined themselves the lawful possessors of
Asia Propria, of Thrace and of Macedon&

The ware, in those countrics, between the Gods and the·
Titum· are themes of the ancient poets. The descriptions of
them contain many particulam, borrowed from antecedent
events and dates. They belong to the original dispersion of
the (iiants from Babel. But there is a degree of local con-
sisteney in the accounts, which compel me to infer, that a
national history is attho bottom. And I am happy to find
this, which has long been my opinion, confirmed by that os
a writer and a critic whose learning and abilities cannot be
enough aclrnired.
