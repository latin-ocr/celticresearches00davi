not then have consisted of fewer than 12 such months or
:360 days. But ifwith the best copies of the 70, and with
some other versions of eredit, we date the 61 days from. the
first of the Eleventlc mouth, this point must be regarded as
fully determined. There will be 12 months and a few days
over, during which Noah waited'for the return of the third
dove, and before he rem‘oved the co‘vering of the ark, on the
first day of thefirst month of the new year. And there is
the greatest probability in favour of this reading. Noah
already knew that tlte watcrs were abated from off the earth.
The question was now, whether the Earth produced any
thing, or whether the dove would be compelled by hunger
to return to the ark. It is not to be supposed that after

‘the patriarch should now wait ‘29 days to make this experi-

purpose. W ould not these circumstances have pointed out
some error in the text, had no ancient version suggested and
authorized i'ts correction? Upon this authority we have
12 months of 30 days days each, and the EpagoneS, or in all
565 days. But how are we* to account for the number and
the precise length os the months? Perhaps something in the
following manner. The first periodieal phoenomenon which.
attracted the notice of our first parents was probably the re-
appearance of the moon, after the change. 'The iteration of
the seasons, and the periodical approach and retreat of the
sun, with which the seasons were obviously connected, must
have also presented themselves to observation. It could not
but be desirable and useful to ascertain the period of these
changes. The moon was resorted to, as the first means of
coinputation, and 12 lunations were found to corne round
nearer to the same point, than any other number: Hence the
tat-elce months. But these were very soon discovered to be too!
short. The object in view was to obtain a knowledge of the
