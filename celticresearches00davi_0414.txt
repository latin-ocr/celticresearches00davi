*that his, and their letters, were those of the lanians, or
descendants from javan, who had hitherto remained in*
Asia. The difference between these letters, and the Pc-
lasgic, in all probability, arose from gradual operations of
time, or from studicd refinements, during the separation of
the kindred families.

It may be asked, in objection,—if the colonist, who
occupied Boeotia, was actually Ionian, why do we not

find him distinguished by that name, in preference to the
term Plcaenician 22

It may be answered‚ that, in early ageS, the name of
Ionians was applied so generally to all Greeks, that it
would have conveyed no distinct idea of a particular dis-
trict, or family3 whereas, the names of Mount Cadmus,
and Monac Phoenix, were of limited appropriation, which
at once pointedout the origin, as well as the native spot of
the new-comers. It may, further, be remarked, that En-
‘ropean Greeks, of later times, in consequence of some
jealousies between the two couno-ies, dislilcecl the name qs*
Iones, avoided the use of it, (md were unwilling to be

called by it. ζΟι μεν νυν amm Ιωνες, και Αθηναιοι, εφνγον ‘roviolam ου
ςουλομενω Ιωνες κεκληςθαι. Η61·ο(]οΐ. L. Ῑ.

Some learned men, taking it for granted, that Cadmus
was a Syro-Phoenz'cian, have laboured the point of ex-
plaining, how the letters of Cadmus may have been formed,
upon the old Samaritan, and have insisted upon it, that all
tlw names of these letters are mere ilnitntions of the Heln-ew.
lt is not, by me, denied, that a remote affinity may bc
discovered, between the two alphabetS. They both ‹lc-
sccndcd, in my opinion, from one source, and, there-
fore, may haue retained a degree of resemblance to each
