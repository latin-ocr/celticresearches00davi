passages, amongst themselves, will discover that it both admits
and requires a considerable limitation.

For, in the first place, the confederacy was not headed by
Noah himself, οι· by either of his sons or grandsonS, but by a
third in deseent from Ham, under whom it cannot be supposed
that, in an age, when patriarchal authority was acknowledged
and respeoled, any of the elder branches would enlist them-
selves. ⁴ Neither Ham nor Cush nor either of his brethren
could then have been amongst the subjeets of Nimrod, or the
Babylonian rebels. ’Δ ’

v Nor did the patriarchs stand out alone. There were also
families or societies of men, who had kept aloof. For the
wickedness and persecution of Nimrod became proverbial, and
continued so for many succeeding generations. “ therefore
it is said, 'Even as Nimrod, the mighty lzzmtcr before tlze L07·cl.‘’
Now this proverb could not have been used amongst his own
subje&s and associates, who embraced his cause⁴ and assisted
in his schemes3 but in certain societies which had rejee‘ted his

authority, and abhorred his conduot3 and consequently became
the objeets of his rage.

And many such societies there evidently were. For as
Nimrod became a mighty humer or persecutor before the
Lord, he must previously have divested himself of all venera-
tion for the Lord, and all submission to his authority.
Amongst the partizans of Nimmd, there could have been no
true piety. Yet in several parts of· the country where
Abraham sojourned, and in the family and amongst the
friends of Job, we find righteous societies, who worshipped
the true God. Their fathers had not been amongst the

hunters before the Lord, or the apostates from the primitive
religion.
