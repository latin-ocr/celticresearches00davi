Secr. II. On tlzc¹sbr772c1tiorz oflaugzcage. Nature of the
prime't'e've language.

TO the preceding disquisition, upon the nature of cle·
mental-y sounds, Ι shall add a few thoughts respecting the
formation of speech, the nature of primitive language,
and the sense, in which it may be' said even still 10,

exist.

That wonderful phenomenon‚ in the history of man, the
organization of language, has attracted the notice of the
learned, and the ingenious. It has given birth to various
hypotheses, which are supported by an elaborate profusiori
of reading, and by acute observations.

There are some, for instance, who regarding language as
entirely of human invention, suppose, as I have already re-
marked, that man bon-owed his vocal, and articulate sounds,
from various 3111111315, and from the 110156 of inanimate things·
—For this reason, they tell us, the letters, which are
the symbols of those sounds, derive their names, and cha-
racters, from the things, to which we owe their several
powersss. This opinion I have already discusscd, and, I
hope, refuted,

Many, of great learning, on the other hand, maintain,
that the Hebrcw, or some very similar language, was
communicated by inspiration to our first parents, complete,
in all its parts. ἶ
