γ In the Celti& qu'reltiizd, the bi'rclz is called beitlz, which
equally Signifies being, essenee, existence. It seems to be
connected with Ir. Both, ΒοζΙιαης W. Bchz, (pl. ngtlz)
{rhun cottage3 Βοοΐῆ, a place of abode, οι· being, equiva-
lent in its meaning, to the Hebrew ΠΒ.

In Welsh, Bjtlt also signifieS,s0r ever, ctcrnity.

The birch, therefore, in the Celtic language, being distin-
lguished bya term, which, priinal·ily‚ imports, being, or exist-
ence, was constituted the symbol of the term, and of the idea
which it conveycd. Italso became the symbol of the letter
B, represented by a sprig of this plant 3—and the remon
was clearly miss—that the power of that letter, connected
with its vocal brenthing, conveyed the. same general idea as
Bcich, by which the birclc was delineated. ⁰

In the Bardic alpltahet, this letter is called Bi, which, in
Irislz, implies the sense of the Latin ι1ἰιίἑ,· in lsclsle, that
of the Latin erit.- in both languages, it is the root of the
essential verb, to Bc.

Recollecting these principles of the &amboliczd syslcm, we
may infer, that, in the rude, and primitive language, Bi,
Be, or Bai, and even the very power of B, when incor-
porated -in the simple terms ofthe first ages, was to con-
vey the idea of being, or aristonem—and that, in the dialects
which carne, as branches, from that languugc, its derivatives
ΠΒ, Raso», Βαις, Beitlz, Roth, Bra-th, byth, ἃς. became ternis
appropriate forplace ‹fbeing—for thc selfsspropzrgating birch,

Such ternis, and the general idea which they attracted,
