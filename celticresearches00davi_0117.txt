into 12 portioris or signS, corresponding with the number of
moons in the first computation. Each of these portioris was
found to consist of 30 days and a finction3 but as it would be
inconvenient to divide a day, the whole number was retained,
and the surplus added to complete the year.

The first idea os a year must have been that of the return of
the sun and the seasons to the same point. And from the
visible revolution of the sun, men must have first obtained.

for a year Πιῐζ) implies an Iteration, Repetition, a Return to
the same point. This could have been no other than the
return of the sun and the seasons. The sun was the great
luminary which, by his regular course amongst the other lights
or starS, was appointed to measure years. Gen. i. 14, 16.

If the moon was first resorted to for the purpose of measuring
the sun's course, it was soon found inadequate to the purpose.
Its revolution had no connection with the return of the seasons4
It only served to suggest a division os the sun's course into 1⁶2,
portions. In most nations, of which any ancient reeords and
traditions are preserved, we find that this division of the year,
and the signs of the zodiac, by which it was marked, were
known from remote ages. The discovery is claimed by several
different nations, a circumstance which generally attends those
inventions which were derived from the common parents of the
nations. The history of the deiuge is understood to be recorded
in the names and delineations of some of the constellations.
