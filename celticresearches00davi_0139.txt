should have multiplied upon the earth, one family might
exercise a lawful dominion over another family. This must
have occurred to Noah, as a natural consequence of the pro-
gressive state of society, and as a necessary repetition of what
had taken place in the primitive world.

For great kingdoms and states appear to have been formed
amongst the antediluvians. They had their heroes and their
conquerors, for such I apprehend were the giants which were
in the earth in those days, who became miglzty men, which
were of old men of* renozcn. Moses has not thought proper to
enlarge upon the renoam of these mightics, yet his oblique
manner of speaking plainly alludes to some known history of
them. They are not reprehended for the possession but the
abiise of power. The general history of the antediluvians had
not then been totally lost.

Several heathen nations retained some fragments of this
history for many ages. The Greek and Roman mythologists
give us details of the ac‘tions of certain giants before the flood,
but the story is spoiled by embellishment. The genuine works
of Berosus, as we are told by Syncessus, contained the reigns
often kings of Chaldea before the flood. This was the exa&
number of the patriarchs from Adam to Noah, both inclusive.
Their residence seems to have been in the neighbourhood of
the Euphrates.

Nimrod, the mighty humer, may then have done no new
thing upon the earth, when he established a kingdom in
Babylonia. The formation and maintaining of kingdoms and
governmentS, whether good or bad, must suppose on the one
hand, a diversity of conditions, and, on the other, a cons-ia
derable progress in civilization‚ and the exercise of many arts³
which could not but be useful and ornamental to society⁴²
