According to our. Bardic documents, the Cymty have
preferred their claim to an ancient connection with not
only the territories‚ but the mythology of Greece. lt will
add much to the influence and credit of British. histories, if
it shall appear, that ancient Greece acknowledged the same

but imperfectly informed of local facts respecting them.
However‚ some of their best authors, do furnish us with.
particulars, which may assist us in our search for their abode.
