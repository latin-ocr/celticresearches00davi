N.

When we put forth the hand, οι· extend the finger, to
discriminate a simple, or minute object, the eye is naturally
directed 'the smne way: wnxxlook stedfastly at that which we
wish another to obscrve. The tonguen at the same instant,
spontanemub* mimics the action of the hand and the eye,
by thrusting fwrward its point, in the sixme direction, till it
rests against the upper gntus, The breath, being denied a
‚passage through the mouth, tends towards the same spot,
through the nostrils, with the souud of η, or Hn.

This sound ἰε, then, a natural interjection for look!
lothere! and it is as naturally ann-wered by M, or Ilm—1

obscrve, οι· comprehensi.

May we not, then, pronounoe, that the power η, is a na..
tural expression of an object, subject, thing produced, or
uerev—discriminate& or simplificd-——the sdfszzme, simple,
small?

Its Rau-dic name is Ni. The most general appropriation
of this term is, as a negative, not .· but this iS‚ by the same
kind of figure which produced ελκχιςτα, from ιλαχιςτος,
minime from miminus, and the Frende negative, point and

pas, from nouns of a corfined meaning.
