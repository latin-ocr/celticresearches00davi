4. The 'Barda name is oo, or w, which, at present, con-
stitutes no complete term, in the Celtic language. I must
here remark, that there seems to be some error, in the con-
ception of our late Bards, respecting this vocal power.
They regard it' not as a primitive, but as an inflection ot
derivative of o ,· yet it is distinguished in their alphabet, by
a simple character, the general criterion of their mdical
letters, whilst the character Of 0 is an evident compound
of their a and broad ας and the Welsk language, in more
than a thousand instances, regularly contracts ow into ο.
The broad u, on the other hand, has frequently usurped the
province of the ancient o, to the detriment of etymology.
Notwithstanding this irregularity, the genuine force and
import of u may be distinguished, in a multitude of very
simple terms. ’

Thus, in We lslz—¹

Hu, an overloolcer, or guardian: szd, illusion .· szdcl,
a covert, slzade: Heiv, a mantling, or coverz'ng: Πᾶς, a
cont, loose gomet: Hle, a cover, cover-let.- Hzin, a fit qf
sleep, slumber: va, a Ιιοοᾱ, or coc-cl.- st, a covering,

hozaesing, ltorsecloclz.

U, or W, retains its peculiar force, with different initials
and finals3 as, Bw, an overseer: Rwl, a round, leollow
body: Beer, an enclosnre: Bw, a leole, concavity: (ἔω,
concavity: Cwb, concwitq, a cup ,- Cumk, any round hollow

Czcv, re‘sing over, compressing: Cwll, thestomach: Omma
lzollow, slteltcr: (Iter, a berder, nook: th, a cot, stef:
Οτι, black: Dal), mortar, plaster.
