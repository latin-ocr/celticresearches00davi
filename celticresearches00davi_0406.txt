M'r. Sca-mmm, Brit. Antiq. P. 439, giVes the following
account of the abusc of these letters, and of their disgrace.

“ The Ram'c characters were made use of by Woden,
not only for inscriptions, but for magica] charms, and im-
precations: and for this reason, after the faith of Christ
was received, the Rzmic characters began to grow so far
out of credit, that many, spurred on with too much zeal,
not only destroyed such bewitching fooleries, where they
found them, but burnt, without distinction, all sorts of
books written in that letter, and defaced monuments, and
old inscriptions, for no other reason, but because they bore
the character. Yet, nevertheless, the dotage of the vul-
gar, on these uncouth letters, and the opinion, they con-
tained iu them a certain power, and enei-gy (which appre-
hension yet remaineffl, among the simple, in their chaum,
to this day) maintained its ground, so long after Chris·
tianity itself, that Locccnins witnesseth, Sigfrid‚ an English
bishop, thought it necessary to have them altered, which hc
did by the assistance of the Pope, who utterly banished
them from Szeedeland, in the year 1050, and substituted the
Latin character in their room. The same usage they found
in aS'paz‘n, under Alphonszts, Ki'ng qf' Castile, and Navar,
in the year 1086, and were, at last, finally condemned in
the council of Tleoloun, in the year 1116.”

The arrangement of the an'c alphabet, was different
from that of the Irislc, or the Bardic,· but this difference,
may have arisen from some local conceit, of either nation.

The Rnnes had also peculiar nameS, which, undoubtedly,
had their mcanings, in the dialect which first imposcd
them3 as F, fei,- O, 0y85 R, Ridlua·,· J, Iis ,·- S, b'olg
T, Tyr, ἃς. ’
