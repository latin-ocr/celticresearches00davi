p sstefaoe,

An earlier knowledge of these authorff
would have assisted me in adjusting my ar-
gumentS‚ and propositions: it would have
spared me the labour of some proofs built
upon experiment, which employed a tedious
length of time (though, ultimately, making
no figure in the work) and would have been
clear gain to me in perspicuity of arrange-
ment 3—-but it would have endangered my at-
tentions to the main object. It might have
seduced me, by the influence of learning, to
borrOW, or invent systemS‚ when it was my

humble office to develope, authenticam, and
confirm the use of materia15‚ constructed

many ages ago.

It is with infinite sati‘sfaction, however,
that I observe an occasional coincidence be-
tween some of my notices, and those of the
authors to whom I have adverted3—because
thc force of truth could alone have led us to
the same identical spot, by routes uncon-
nomed, as well as intricate.
