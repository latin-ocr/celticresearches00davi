Supposing that the course of nature was changed at the
deluge, it must be obvious that neither lunar months nor the
year of 360 days could have been adequate to the purposes
of agriculture or of pasturage. They would by no means cor-

and suggesting the necessity of reformation‚ to a society in·-

Some societies may have gradually sunk into such a state

cision the length of the year, they may therefore have
neglectcd and forgotten the scicnce of their ancestors. But
in many caseS, it is probable that the scantiness or imper-
fcffion of ancient documents may have betrayed us into
some error upon this subject. A vaguc and familiar mode of
expression, in which many people indulged themselves, may
