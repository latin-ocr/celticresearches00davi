I circulated a short Prospectus in September,
1801. It was in the form of proposaZS, to lay
before the Public (if I could reach that num-
ber by subscription) fiveplzundred copies qs a
single volume.

No sooner were these proposals known,
when I received unequivocal hints of that
munificent‚ and perhaps unexampled‚ patron·-
age‚ which appears in the list annexed.---
Amongst other disadvantage5‚ Which are in the¹
company of these honourS, it is, perhapS,
the heaviest in its oppression of my feelingS,

that I cannot pay the sincere tribute of
my thanks‚ in the detail which is due to

them3 and that I must, with some few ex-
cepfflom, request the indulgence of delicate
liberality‚ if Ι abstain from particulars, which,
if enumerated‚ would not only seem an im·-
pcrtincnce of tributary homage, but would,
perh-ape, be accuscd of pride, under the mask

of gratitudo.
