already exhibited. Before I compare them with cadmean
characters, or those of the modern Greek, it may not be
improper to contemplate, with a retrospect‚ those principles,
and that system, upon which they were constructed.

Being originally intended as ‹lraughtS‚ or sketches, of the
points, or sprigs, or knots of planis, it is to be remarked,
that simple, and radical characters, represent either a straight
⁷·od,—af0rlced sprig‚——a rod, with a single slzoot branching
from it‚—or a simple 1εὴοί οη α ἰῖι’ἰ3·,· as No. Ι. Pl. ii.

The for-lc, or the shoot, always branches off, and with
an acute angle-33 the lsnot breaks the hne, with an ob-
tuse angle. In these particulars, the copy is taken from
the model of nature.

The characters of those compound powerS, which are
now classed amongst the radicals, are formed by the june-
tion of two simplos: as M from B U, O from A U,
No. II.

Derivatives, or mutations, are aecomplished, by adding
to their primi-tiveS, another sltem, or, else, mutes are changed
into their affinities, the semiwoweb, and the aspirates, by
affixing a reecl, whose perforation was the symbol of breatlz-
ing; as in No. ΙΙΙ.

Thus, a fundamental principie is preserved throughout,
with great simplicity‚ and regularity.

In the Ionian characters of Greece, and of Rome, few
