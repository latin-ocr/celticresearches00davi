In the time of Aristeas, (who wrote before Homer) the
Jbsperboreans dwelt upon the sea, beyond the Arimaspi,
and their neighbours, the Essedones. Herod, iv, 13. Her·
cales went from Graece, to the Hyperboreum, through Il-
(qr-inne, and by the river Eridanus, or Po. Apollod,
L. ii. C 4.

Posidonius and Protarchus, placed them near the Alps.
(Gale in Ant. Libet-al, p. 144) but they were not generally
recognised on the south of these mountains, or¹ very near

them.

After passing from one people to another, their gifts ar·-
tived far in the West‚ upon the Adriatic, from whence
athey were carried in the first period, οι· stage, of their pro-
gress, to Dodona, but ultimately to Delos. Herod. iv· 33.

They came, then, from the land of the Celtae, whom

Heraclides of Pontus calls Hyperboreum. Plutarch, ine,
Camillo.

It may be asked, how happens it, if the Hyperboreans
were Celtcc‚ that the Greeks did not generally recognise
them all over Celtica?

It may be answered, that it seems they had conceived a
peculial· character of this people5 and which appears to have
been correct, as bearing upon their primm-js families‚ or tribes 3
but these, were followed by others, of a different cha.-
raeter, and which materially changed the immunem, previ—
ously impressed. The original idea which had been formed
of the nation, was not realized by the Greclffi, till they
reached the interior districts, in which the former inhabi-
tants remained unmixed.
