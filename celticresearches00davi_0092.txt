and from which achain of inferences may be drawn, should
be distinctly marked. For want of such leading objects, it
has frequently happened, that propositions have been as-

harmony, or disagreement, with some preconceived opinion.
It cannot therefore be expected,that general assent must be
the consequence of unfolding first principles3 but at least,
by this means a charge of inconsistency may be avoided.
That charge,l hope to obviate, by presenting a few sketches
of my conceptions‚ relative to the attainments of primitive
society, and by offering a few plain arguments in support of
my opinion. In order to form this opinion, it wasneccssary
to enter into periods, sar beyond the reach ofprofane history.
The first point, that was to be settled, was the choice of the.

that it seems hardly possible, to reduce them into fact. ⁵
Hence the most learned, and sincere investigators of an-
tiquhy, arc far froin being agreed in their interpretation of
poetica! traditions. And this is not to be wondered at:
