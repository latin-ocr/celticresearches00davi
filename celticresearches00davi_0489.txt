languages‚ and thc accidents of terms, became so numerous,
as to render anomalous changes necessary, for the sake
of distinction.

In the fundamentals of speech, we may expect, naturally,

portunity of detecting those changeS, but on grounds of
general analogy.

The first change that took place was, probably, an

occasional omission of the aspirate.

these, upon similar occasions, must have given them a

It became, therefore, no longer necessary, to impress the
