that so many peoplc eontend for the invention of those arts
which were preserved from the first ages, They arc all right:
excepting that they mistake the common progenitors of man-
kind for their own national ancestors; alid of course, whatever
is due to the former, is consigned to the latter.

But the very traditions themselves will furnish sufficient
data to rce‘tify the mistake.

In the time of Alexander the Great, Berosus, a Chaldean
priest, wrote the history of his country, from the remotest
times. Mueh of his genuine work is unfortunately lost. But
Syneellus, an author of good credit, tells us that the first book
treated of the situation of Babylonia, the fruitfulness os the
soil, its trees and plants and other commoditieS, and then ex-
pounded the fables and allegories which enveloped the
theology of the ChaldeanS. The second book treated of T en
Kings ‹fftlze Clealdeans, Emona THE FLooi). If the Chal-
dcans had an exclusive right to the ten maedam-ian patriarclm,
their title to the invention of all primitive arts aud-scienees

must certainly be good.

The Egyptians, however, will disputo the point with them.
Strike thc boasted discoverics of their ancestors out of the
catalogue, and civil society could not have existed. tho
were these aneestors os theirs? ure need not ask the Greeks:
let us enquirc of the Egyptians themselves,

“ Manetho, in one of his books, entitlcd Sothis‚ relates
several things concerning lee Empire osche Egyptian-5, taken
from certain columns, which were engravcd in the sacred
dialect and in hieroglyphie letters, by Thoth, tlte-first* ilIercmy:
