The· systematieal correspondence of the characters in
the Bardic, with a general principle,—-as well as the evi-
dence ⁴of ancient inscriptions‚—gives the palm vof antiquity
in their favour, and the decision is further supported by
a very marked feature.

Several Greek, and Roman characters, do not correspond
with Celtic ναάίσαῖε, but with some of their derivatives, or
mutations. Thus, No. VII. from the Celtic B, comes its de-
rivative Bk, or V, by a slzoot, in addition to its primitive,
as observed before: hence were formedGreek, and Roman
B, by czcrving the slmots. From the Celtic C. (K) comes
ch guttural, by affixing a reed, and this is precisely the
K of Greece. From the C elt⁶ic D, comes Dh, (as Th in that)
by affixing a reed, as before ; hence the Greek Δ, and the
Roman D, by curving the angular line. From the Celtic
E, comes ὃ, hence the ancient Ξ reversed, of Greece, and
of Italy, by opening the angles, and by adding a slroot.
From P, comes Ple, or F, by the addition of a sleoot, as
bef01·e‚-hencc the Roman F, and sEolz'c digamam, as it has
been called. From the same P, comes the mutation Ph,
by affixing a rced, and hence our present Greek Π.

From the evidence, adduced in this work, I hope it is
made clear, that the old alphabets‚ which I have now com-
pared, were originally one and the same, which had been
imported into Europe, by several of the emigrating su-
milies, who had settled in this western continent 3——tliat
[our Druids, and Bar-ds of the Celtae, preserved an authen-
tic, and respectable copy of this general alphabet, and that
