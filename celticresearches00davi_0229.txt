THE irruption of the Goths into the territories of
the western Celae, being an event comparatively recent,
could have had nothing to do with the national habits, 01
national institutes of the latter. We must therefore distingui&
the Celtic establishment Draidzsssm, from the Gothic 111 3511015111

was acknowledged. The original and primitive inhabitai‘its of
this bland, at some remote period of antiquity, rex-ised and
reformed their national institutes. Their priest 01· instruet&
had hitherto been simply named Capi: or Gzcydd, as the term

the natioual or superior priest, and a subordinate charaeter,

former became Der—zrydcl or Drnid, which, in the language
of the people to whom we owe the term, is a eompound of
Dar, Superior, and ngvdd, a Pricst or Inspec‘ior: The latter
was (ἕο-ἵεμαι] 01· Ovydd, a subordinate Instrufftom and was
sometimes called Syro or Sy-wydd, names familiar to the
Bai-ds, Talc'esz'n and Λιιεανὲη.
