the genius of the several dialects3 yet, it preserveS, through÷
out, evident vestiges of some one original word. Not
presuming to determine what that word is, or was, I shall
only observo, that in more than one Celtic dialect, bret, sig-¹
nifies a womb ,- Ad,—-iterati0n‚ repetition of the same3 and
ur,-—amc17z. Brzcccd, then, is an offspring, or produce qs
tlte same womh5 and ὂνιιαιῖιιν, α man, produced by ihc
same zeombf³

But, according to my conception 'of the subject, a more
fruitful source of the diversity in ternis, must be explored
in the original nature of all terms, which is relative, or de·-
scriptive,—not fixed, οι· absolute. And, for' this reason it is,
that, not only adifference of dialects, but one, and the same, ,
dialect, may have great variety 'of names for the same
thing3 when it may be viewed under a variety of relative
characters. Thus, a son, in Irish, is called mac, which is
a nursling, from the word macam, I sustain, or support„
This is equivalent, in its meaning, to the Latin alumnus.-
bar, a shoot, or offspring ,· propago .· ονε, a germ, or seed3
progenies: Imm, a small one, from lu, small5 parvulus„-
nion, an image, or lz'lceuess, &ci>

Had five distinet Families‚ been separated from the'
Irislz nati0n‚——had they colonised as many desart islands,
in which their posterity retained only one of these termS,
and applied it in the same absolute manner as we do the
word son,—-it is evident, that, in this instance, the new in-
habitants wohld no longer be able to recognise the relative,
or descriptive, nature of these words,-—0r the original iden·
tity of their several dialects.

This example is not singular. In the same language,
