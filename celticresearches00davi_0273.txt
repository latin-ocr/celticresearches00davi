The most considerable of these has been described by
Hrculem, and by other celebrated authors upon ancient

tradition, cited by Diodorus Siculus.

Hence it should seem, the Hyperboreum, who brought

favorite maxim of Drm'ds, who abstained from contest,
and allayed every popular ferment, was, according to Diog,
