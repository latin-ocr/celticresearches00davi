mythological fiction. W e see the symbolical system of the ⁸
ancients only in its exterior application3 we see a certain
species of crozms, and rods, used upon particular occasions ;
we see particular Gods venerated under the symbols of their
appropriate plants, or trees ‚- and the learned content them-

originally from the same fountain.

This analogy may be observed in the terms of Greek and
Roman languages: but, as these terms are more ancient
than gramm-ars of those languages, which are extant,

Thus Δξυας may be derived from 3qu arbor, and from
