there niust have been shades of peculiarity, amongst the
vernacular idioms of the populace: and the Armorican, or
Celtogalatz'an langmge, in the (lays of Caesar, appears to
have differed from the lflsclslz, much in the same degree as
at present.

In order to prove this,I must have recourse to Etyma·
Iogy, who, though a rash leader, is a most valuable sub·
altem. Caesar calls the district, civitates Armorica. Ar-

locality of these states, In Welsfc, ar, is upons-mor, the
sea,—whenee morig, maritime .- the name, in that case,

maritime—tlte maritime (states).

The Welsh call that country Llydaw, from Llcd (Let)

εαηε, at the end of their wordS, uniformly substitute S—hard,
which, the Romans frequently mark by the letter Χ. The
Lexovii· are mentioned by Caesar, as a people by the
water side.

This word is Armorican—-Les, a sicle, and Govea, in com·
position, ovea, waher,- literally the water side.

The people of Le Pcrche, in the western extremity of
the country, are called Diablintes, Diabell, in Bas-Bre-
ton, is longinquus, plural, ‹liabelliuc—tlze remote ones· In
llfelslz, they would have been called Pelletzigi'on

From Belem, mentioned by Ausonius, in the passage
above quoted, comes the Armorican Bel-cc, priest, pl.
Bestiam—Putem, a minister of Apollo, is nothing more than
