remarked‚ invented metallurgy, and instmeted artificers in
Brass and Iron3 whilst others were cultivating the fine aits,
and teaehing men to handle the harp and the orgari, both
string and wind instruments. These arts were so far from
being lost, that in the oldest picture of society after the
deluge, we meet with “ Bows of steel, and molten Mirror5‚”
things which could never have existed, or have been rendered
fit for use, without considerable skill in the tempering‚ com-
pounding and polishing of metals. In the same book also,
the harp and the orgari, the identical kinds of instruments
taught by J ubal, are repeatedly mentioned. Hence it appears
that not only such arts as were indispensably necessary, but
even the ornamenta] arts of the antediluvians, were carefully
preserved.

distinction of animals into clean and unclean. And ⁴this
distinction was known before the flood3 for it was the general
rule by which he was to determine the number of each species
to be admitted into the ark. Of every clean beas-t, and of
every clean fowl, he took unto him by sevenS‚ or seven pairs
of each sort; and of the unclean‚ by single pairs. It is clear
then that the primitive ages had made some progress in the
study of natural history: they had had their Linnei and their
Buffons3 for when an observance of the same distinction of
clean and unclean animals is enjoined to the Israelites
(Lev. xi) we find that it required and depended upon an ac-
curate classification of the genera, agreeably to their several
natural marks or characters, Thus quadrupe-ds were classed
into 1. Those which were clovenfooted and chewed the eud.
2. Those which were clovenfooted and chewed not the eud,
3. Those which chewed the eud and were not clovenfooted.
4. Those which neither chewed the eud nor were eloven·
footed. In like manner aquatic animals were distinguished
