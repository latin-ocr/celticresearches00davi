Barda· is pcrceivcd. And the evidence of inscrip-
tions, the farther we ascend backwards into antiquity‚
amounts to absolute proof, that most of the difference,
which now appears between them, is due to the changes
which took place in Greek, and Roman letters. The
more ancient we find the several specimens, the nearer we
discover their approach to the Bardic sprigs. The reason
is clear. The letters of tlte more learned people were con-

I shall now exhibit proofs of relation between these al·

1. Several of the respective⁰ characters retain so much
resemblance of shape, that an original identity is evident‚
at the first view; as in No. IV.

2. In other instances, the Ionian series merely opens
the angles of the Bardic sprigs, into right angles3 as at

No, V.

3. Sometimes they merely sofren the angles into curves;

asin No. VI.

Ionian letters, waS, originally, the same, and that, accord-

cion. Similar characters had anciently been used in Greece,
