Snc'T. III. Of the Coranied or first invaders ‹gf-Britain
-α discrimination qftlze Celtic dialects, with short ro—

marks on tlze general character qfthe Celtic Ianguage.

OUR Britislz documents being found agreeable to the
account which the oldest authors give of the Cyan-y, and os
their institutions, Ι shall offer a few remarks upon the

Corarzicd, whom thoy represent as the first hostile invaders
of Britain.

These were preceded by the Celyddon, Gtc‘yddyl and
szyr Galedin (No. ΠΙ.) who arriving after the country

had been settled, were admitted, under some restriction of
privileges.

It appears to me, that the uibes here named, were still of
Celtic origin, came from both banks of the Rhine, and were
praecursores of the Belgce, who, at several distinct periods‚
obtained, and possessed, by force, great part of the island«

These people, who make a considerable figure in the his-
tory of Britain, are styled Comuied, 0 zelady pwyl, and,
in a passage already adduced, it is affirmcd, that, originally,
thoy came from Asia.

Though Coranz'ed be their most general name in these
triads, yet we often find oue of this nation termcd me,
the giaut, and this name, as often contracted into Cor,
whivh forms in its plural, Coricd, or corion.
