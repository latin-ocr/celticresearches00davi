ber of simple terms, than we do, and as the several tribes
which use this dialect, or those connected with it, were not
completely received into the pale of Brite'sk Druidism, it may,
Ι think, be inserted, that the Irislz, after we have discarded
its eastern, and such other adventitious termgas cannot be
derived from its native roots, presents the most accurate
copy of the Celtic in its original, and primitive state, in
the same manner as the lfelslz does that, of the cultivated, or
Druidical Celtic. But in order to obtain a sound and a deep
knowledge, of the general, and the discriminate character
in the (ἶεῖιζίε, we should compare all these dialects to-

gether.

Ι shall add some discriminate marks of the Celtic, con·
sidered as one language.

tions of the formem as, Bk, or V, from B ‚- Ch, or χ, from
C ,· DJ», or Dd, (as th in that) from D, 85⁶.

All words used absolutely, or out of regimen, begin with
primary sonnds, except a few modern corruptions, in
Cornislz‚and A rmorz'can, which admit of the V ,- and Welsla
words in Ch, where the initial, vowel, or syllable, is
dropped.

Primary soundS, in composition, are not only changed
