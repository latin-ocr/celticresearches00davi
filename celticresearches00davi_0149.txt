Instead of Ἠλῖ), the children of men, may have employed
moy, Amud, A Column or pillar, a term nearly synonimous
with the former, and which is emphatically applied to The
pillars of Heaven, or the Comes of mmmtains, and therefore
was a very apt term to describe that tower, whose top mght
reaclz to Heaven. The name would then stand thus 'imp 'vy Ξῖί)
Shem OirAmud. Hence perhaps the Semiramis, Semiramid-os
of mythology, the name by which Ninus or the Ninevice, in a
subsequent age, married, or took possession quABYLON.

If this conjecture be admitted, we may regard Nive-rod and
Babel as names which were imposed only by the enemies of
this ambitious prince. And the prevale-nce οἱ these names
proves that his enemies were numerous.

Are we then to conclude, that the associates of Nimrod
consisted solely of his brethren and their children? This
will by no means follow. For, had one family only formed
a conspiracy, the express reason here assigned for their
enterprize could not have applied. In that case, they could
not have been forced upon the expedient of making themselves
a name, “ Lest they should be seattered abroad upon tlzesacc
qf' the whole earclz,'' for their destined habitation, as one
family, must have been in some certain part of the earth, and
in the neighbourhood of each other3 whereas, on the
contrary, they clearly understood that it was intended, they
should be separated from one another, to the most remote
corners. And accordingly, we find that the Lord interposed
his power, while they were yet in the prosecution of their
design, beginning to build the city and the tower, and
scattered them stom thence upon tlte ficce (fall tlze earth. In
all probability, he scattered them into those several regionS,
which had been originally destined for their respective
habitationS, and whither many of their obedient brethrcn had
already repaired.
