reinains of what was once common to the whole human race.
They are part of the stores of the antediluvian world trans-
mitted by the patriarchs to their posterity.

Of the civil arts, and the seiences of the primitive world
which were thus preserved and transmitted‚ 1 shall offer
some slight ext1·a6ts-the list may be abundantly enlarged
by diligent research.

1. Agriculturc and pasturage are recorded as occupations of
the very first age: and these were, in a remarkable degree,
the employments of Noah, Abraham, Job, and the other
patriarehs in¹ the ages which sueceeded the flood. The im-
mediate descendants of Noah, as well as of Cain, dwelt in
tents and possessed cattle.

2. The firstborn of human parents was also the first builder
of a city; and the history of Babel affords a proof that the
art of building was not forgotten. Noalr must have been
eminently skilled in this art, as well as in a multitude of
others, which are necessarily subservient to it. The great
patriarch received only a few general insu-uffions as to the
form and dimensions of the ark. From these he was enabled
to construet that enormous fabric, with such firmness and
cornpaetness as to resist the waters of a deiuge which over-
whelmed the world. We have no authority to assert that
the art of naval architeefflre was new, but whatever progress
may have been made in it, this design was vast: it far ex-
ceeded any thing that has been undertaken in the docks
of modern Europe. It must therefore have called in a num·-
ber of useful arts which are not expressly recorded, but which
were undoubtedly handed down to the next generation.
