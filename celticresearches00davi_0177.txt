perhaps they conferred upon them still higher titles; for, in
the Old Testament we find such names as Gods, Sons ‘ff G od,
Sons qftlze D‘Iost Higlz, given to human beings. The precise
ideas originally intended by these ternis, when so applied, in
time became confused3 and men began to regard those who
had been honoured with them, as dignified with a sacred
diameter, and endon-ed with a superior nature„

Just so, the respeet which was once paid to the memory of
the saints and 111a1·tyrS‚ and the preservation of their pic'tures
and statues, were far removed from superstition and idolatry:
but now, for many ageS‚ men have ascribed to the same
saints an absolute ubiquity, an incommunicableattribute of
the Deity. They have invoked them in their prayerS, and
bowed domi before their images„
