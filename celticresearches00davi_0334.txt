When their “ six thousand year-5,’' have been reduced
within bounds of probability, it must bc acknowledged, that
at least they have claimed the use of letters, from the time
when they first became a distinct society. They seem cvi-
dently to have branched from the Celtic stock. Mela, the
geographer, born in the neighbourhood, and, therefore, no
stranger to its inhabitants, omitting their name altogether,
extends the Turduli over those regionS, about the banks
of the Anas, which Ptolemy, and some others, divide be-
tween the Turduli, and the Turditam'. This learned
Spanimd, then, regarded them as one people, and he
places their anceStOrS, or the Turduli verberea, in the middle

of Lusitania, a coast, as to which he affir1ns.—-“ Totam

antiquity‚ the Celtas possessed letters, not very dissimilar to
those of the ancient Greeks.
