But may it not be asked, if the most peculi-ar instances of
similarity, thus noticed between the Eczsb and the chs't, do
not reflth the general character ot' the patriarchal age, and
primitive man, before his family had separated? , [f 50, why
should we derive Annivm-sals from particulam? The distant
branches of a spreading oak, notwithstaxnling the diversity of
s-:hape which they acquire, from their exposure to diflerent
winds, have still a mutual resemblance, in their texture, their
foliage, and their fruit3 which they derive, not from each
other, but from the parcnt acorn.

Do we not find this primitive charaeter, so deeply impressed
upon the Celtae, 50 general through their land, and at 50
early an age, as to make it impossible for the dyc to have
been fixt by wandel-ing navigator-S, or the local settlement of
a few strangerS, whose objetst was profit, and who must them·
selves have been objeEts of distrust? As all nations originally
came from one stock‚ and, at an age, when the habits of
society were developed, would it *not be reasonable to conclude,
that some general customs and opinions of the human race
were natur-alized 111 the land, by the first families who settled
in the Western Continent 2 ⁴

The Greeks had been a powerful peopleat Men-scillas, many
centuries before Caesar⁷s time. The ancient inhabitants, who
remained in the land which they occupied, may have learnt
several arts and habits from them: But the vicinity of those
Greeks appears not to have effefted any change in the Religion
or the Characffer of the Gaulislc Nation. ’

Abating then for these instances 111 which history demon-'-
strates their obligation to exotio aid, I cannot resuse to 'the
Celtae and their Druids, the full credit whiclr is due to them,
for having preserved those genuine features of primeva?
