the ground work of Druidism had been, at least, coeval to
the Celtic nation. If this be admitted, it will not seem im-
probable, that the general principles of their symbolieal
alphabet, together with all the radieals of the language,
upon which it was founded, were not the invention of the
Drnids, asa national order of men, but were preserved

by them, from that period, when tlzefamilz'es of the earth
were divided.

That the Druids did in fact preserve the memory of re-
markable things, from this remote age, I have already
shewn, and as the &mitiss-indeed the Celtas, in general,
are represented, not as an inventive people, but as extremely
tenacious of old custonm, it may be well presumed, that
this curious system, which unites their hieroglyphics, and
their letters, had been formed, as to its general principles,
before their migration out of Asia‚-and that the Druids
ei‘ther preserved it, as they found it, or else acted upon an
established principle, in accommodating the symbols to
their own circumstances, and their own situation.

And this will appear to be confirmed, not in theory alone,
but, in fact, if attention is given, to the D-ruidical account
ofthe invention, and so as to compare the system, in its pro·
gressive stages, with those analogies, which may be traced‚
in very ancient periods, and in eountries, where the
influence of the Gaulish, and Britislz, Druz'cIS, as a local
order, could not have operated. The former of those topics
l shall touch upon, in this present section.

ln T aliesin’s account of the invention of the system, there
are mythological allusions, that would require considerable
depth of learning, and more habits of leisure than mine to
elucidate. Ι shall only endeavour to represent a few par*
