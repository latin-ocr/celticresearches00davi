which the Celtae os Gaul were the most powerful of nations,
in the west of Europe,-1nade incursions,—and settled colo·

the establishment of the Gotlzs in that country.

These peculial· circumstances, together with a dcfcct of
precision, too frequent in describing strangers, will account
for the extent of the term Celtae, as covcring tlte north, just
as wc speak at present of Tartars, and of radians, not
adverting, minutely‚ to distinctions, amongst those who are
imperfectly known to uS.

But this indefinite use of the name, can, surely, never be
understood as meaning to impart the idea, that Celtae, and
Goths, constituted one, and the same, people, They are
accurately distinguished, by some of the best authors- They
differed essentially in stature, complexion, habits, manners,
language, as well as in every other character which marks
unconnected nations.

The families of the Goth are sufficiently ascertained: and
the genius of lais language is completely known, in its very
numerous dialects.

Those who occupied the interior of Gaul, distinguished
themselves in their own language by the name of Celtae.†
This name, then, when used with precision, means to de-
scribe the people, of whom these Gauls constitute a part.

³* Coes. De. B. Gal. vi. 24.

† Caes. De Β. Gal. i. 1. This name pertained universally to the Gauls. ‘³ T1¹e
custorn of calling them Galatae, or Gauls, has' only prevailed of late, they were

{Eiiu}rll{ named Celtae, both by themselves, and by others.'' Ραιιεαη Anio. p. 61
