The hero receives directions from Prometheus, how to ob-
tain the fruit, namcly, that he should attend his 'brother
Atlas, the Hyperboreum, and get him to fetch it, out of

the neighbouring garden of the Hesperides. Apollodor.
L. ii. C. 4. 5¹²

It will be recollected, that Prometheus was one of the
Iapetidae, and-son, or native inhabitant, of Asia Propria,
who had been expelled from thence to the neighbourhood
of llIount Caucasus, in Asiatic Scythia, as Atlas himself
had been driven from the same native spot, into the west of

Europe. It appears from hence, to what family these
apples belonged.

We are informed, by our Britislz triuci's, that the first
name given to this island, before it was inhabited, was Clcis'
merdin, the gardera of Merddin. W. Arch. V. Q, P. 1.
The name of Merddin has been conferred upon old bar-ds,
but is originally, a mythological term. His tzoin sister i⁸s
Gwenddycld, or the morning star: He must have been
himself some luminary, in α similar character.

Merddin, if Mer-Diu, be its root, is (lzceller of the ερας
if Mer-daia gives it birth,⁴ it is, the comely one of the sea.

*¹ Several of 1116 ancients, who wrote aster the Carthagenians had extended
their voyagcs, describe 1116 seat of Atlas and the Hesperides, as attached to
Africa. It is very usual 1ο distinguish newly discovered places, by familiar
names. 'llius wc have Neu> Englaud, iu America3 New Helland, and Ncw 8011111
Wulcs. ainongst 1116 Antipodcs.

Apollodorus, the accurate recorder of tradition, corrects the error.

Atlas, and the gru-dens of the Hesperides, were not, as some represent them to
have been, in Lybia5 but amongst the Hyperboreans.
