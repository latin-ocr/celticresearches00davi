the deiuge and died teu years before Noah, we are told
obliqueiy that the earth was dividec'l. The manner in* which
this event is touched upon by Moses shows that the circum-
stances of it were familiarly known in his time. But our
accounts of it are rather scanty. In one other passage, the
sacred historian alludes to the time, “ W hen the Most High
divided to the nations their inhe1·itance.'’ From these passages
we may cosse& that, by a Divine decree‚ there was a soiemn
division of the countries amongst the descendants of Noah.
This division took place in the time of the great patriarch,
and there can be no doubt but it was conducted under his
inspeetion⁵ and ascertained by lot, as we find a similar
division of the land of Canaan amongst the israelites.

Throughout Gen, c. x. Moses is not speaking of a com-
pulsory separation of families; but of a regular division of the
earth amongst the Noachidae. “ The sons of Japheth-—By
these were the isles of the gentiles divicled, in their Laws.-
The sons of Ham-—in their countries and in their nativus.—
The sons 0fShe111-in their lands, after their natione. These
are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the
carth after the flood.’' v. Ω, 5, 20, 31, 3⁶2.

The name of Peieg gives occasion to specify the time,
when tlte land was dividcd, not fflcen tlte pcople were scattered
abroacl. The narrative of this division is interrupted only by
the incidental account of the rebellion and ambition of
Nimrod, the subject of which is resumcd and its consequences
described chap. xi. lf Mmrod’s kingdom comprized the
whole of mankind, their scattering abroad must have been,
each into his land, agrceably to the previous division3 but it is
sufficientiy evident that Nimrod's empire was not universal.--
