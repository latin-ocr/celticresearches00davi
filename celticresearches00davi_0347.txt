'This task, of impl-oving, and of maturing a series of
general tokens, into elementary letters, seems to have been
an effort of invention, so far surpassing the degree of
acumen, ascribed usually to a rude, and primitive tace,
that few, perhaps, will agree to its trudi, upon any argu·

then, be more desirable, to rest the cause, upon evidence

The following observations, however, may serve to shew,
that, at an early period of society, and amongst a people,
who spoke a language, resembling the (radit-al) Celtic3
such an invention would have been more natural, and more
obvious, than it could be, in the modern state of cultivated
nations.

Though the system of the Druidicczl symbols, as far as
we have hitherto traced it, had no visible dependence on
particular words; yet, its general connection with language,
'was obvious, and was necessary.

Let it be supposed, for instance, thata Druid had con-
