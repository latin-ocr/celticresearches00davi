Dion. Hal. L. IV. speaking of the column, upon which
Servius Tullus caused his laws to be written, says, that the
same column remained even to leis time, in the temple of
Diana, inscribed with letters, which Greece anciently used,
namely, the Pelasgic.

The other Greek alphabet, and which remains in use,
had the several names of Ionian, Pltaenzâ€™cz'an, Cadmean,
or Aiolian : and it is represented, as having been imported
imo Baeotia, by an Asiatic colony, about 1500 years
before Christ. The Greeks call the conducter of this colony
Cadmus, and the people, who composed it, Phasma-iaus,-
but, under the former name, we may, perhaps, more pro-
perly understand a people, called Cadmssans, from their
former place of residence. That such a colony did, in fact,
arrive, and wrought a memorable change in the alpliabet
of Greece, are facts, attested with so general a voice of
antiquity, as to admit of no (lebate. But, of whom this
colony consisted, and froin whence it came, are circurn-
stanccs less evident.

The territory of the T yricmS, and Sidoniam, was called
Pltoenicia by the later Greeks. It was thc district best
known to them by that name, and the most celebrated
country, to which the name was applied. Consequently,
ancient authors have acquiesced in the opinion, that
a Thebon colony came from the Tyricm coast. To this
opinion, several of the learned nioderns have subscribed,
and have concluded these einigrants to have sprung sronx
the racc of the Canaanites.

But, though it has been a general persuasion, it has
not been universally admitted.
