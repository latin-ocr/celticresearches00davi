Chap. xv.

From these and similar passages, we must inser, that a
general stoek of knowledge had been treasured up by the great
patriarehs, for the benefit of their posterity3 and that good
men amongst the descendants of Noah, for several generations,
regarded it as their greatest wisdom to learn and attend to
these traditions of their fathers, who lived many days upon
the earth.

We also leam that the rapid abridgment of the period of
human life, which was not only recent but progressive in the
{ime of J ob, had struck the race of mortals with a consterna-
tion ⁴plhieh, for a while, eheeked the ardour of original inves-
tigati0n‚ and damped the eonfidenee of genius, The life of
man still eomprehended a space of, at least, two centuries;
yet memregarded themselves, when compared with the fonner
age, but of yesterday. They could not extend the limits of
snowledge, because their days on earth were as a shadow.-—=
All they could pretend to was, to preserve those inestimable
neasures which they had derived from happier times.
