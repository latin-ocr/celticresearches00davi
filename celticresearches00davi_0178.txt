The remains of one Language

 

ΒΗΤ in whatever degree the subjee‘ts of Nimrod may have
contributed to the corrupting of the primitive religion of
mankind, we cannot surely ascribe to them the introduciion
of those numerous terms, both sacred and profane, which
diffused themselves amongst a great variety of nations, pre·
serving every where, either a striking similarity or an abso-
lute identity of sound aud sense. Tluy cannot surely have
been the authors of that general aualogy which has been
remarked and demonstrated, between the principles of all
ancient languageS.

It is more reasonable to suppose, that these things are the
remains of the one language qf tlte whole earth5 which was
best preserved by the obedient familias. And that centre of
union which is frequently traeed to the vencrable language of
the Pentateuch confirms the supposition-

An identity of terms and principles could not have been
communicated to the several ilations, by that people who
peculim-ly lost the primitive languagc, and who retained not
the use of one language amongst themselves

That there are eviclcnt vestiges of such identity, has been
abundantly proved. We can scarcely open a book, upon any
learned sufficet, in which they do not present themselves.
