Idris, or Edris, is well known to the Arabians. They

The Eastern Christians tell us, that Idris was the same
with Hermes, or Men-cury, the famous T rismegistus of the
Egyptians. See Vallencey's Prospect. V. Dres.

Grecicm mythology gives a similar name toAtlas, the

The Sages, the son of Genius. Without inquiring after the

old bards distinguished the Galaxy by his name, calling it,
Caer Gwyddion. See O. Dice. V. Caer.

The last of these luminaries was a person of no small im·
