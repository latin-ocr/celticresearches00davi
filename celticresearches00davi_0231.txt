In Caesar‘s time, the inhabitants of Gaul had been.
disturbcd, in some degree, by thc intercourse of strangerS.
Their sacred groves had been traversed and violated by feet,
which they considered as profane. Druidism, thercx'orc, was
not so pure in that country as in Britain, the source of
the reformed institution, and many sons of thc nobles in
Gaul were sent hither to finisli their Education. Dc. Bell.

WVhen the Romans acquired a footing in Britain, they
found the country possessed by two nations; the Belgae,
originally Cema, but somewhat intermixt with strangers, and
an indigenous race, who declared they were· born in the
Island. The title of Ναίὶιέ is a distinction claimed by the
first race of a country, and justly———a ιῘὶῃηίίμ had originally
settled3 but the natam was born in the land. Amongst these
pure descendants of the Celtae, the Druidism of Britain was in
the highest repute. The principal seat of the order was found
in Mona, an interior recess of that ancient racc, which was
horn in tlte IslamL

Into that sequestercd scene, the DruidS, who detested
warfare, had gradually retired, after the irruption of the
Belgae, and the further incroaehment of the Romans. They
had retired from their ancient, magnificent seat at Abury, and
from their Circular, Um-overcd Temple on Salisbury Plain, in
which the JIypcrborcan sages had once chaunted their hymns
to Apollo, or Plcuyz.

An order thus cautiousl y withdrawing itself, into the bosom
os its primitive nation, of whom it consisted, and for whom it
was calculated, could not have owed its fundamental principles
to any foreigners, or have been willing to adopt their tenetS.
The Celtae must have received this institution from their very
earliest parent&
