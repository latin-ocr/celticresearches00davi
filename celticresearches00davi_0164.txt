'May Ι nothe allowed to infer from this series that, about
the time of Reu’s birth, Heber, who had passed over, or who
occupied tlze opposite side of the stream, had collected? his
friends and relatives in socia] ιιηὶοης or else, that the Hebrews-
had already betaken themselves to the peaceful occupatiori of
shepherds———that about the time when Serug was born, Nimrod
was extending his kingdom on both sides of the Euphrates,
and building Erech and Accad and Calneh, the outposts of
his great city, and that, in consequence of this, the Hebrews
now began to be perplczed, zceak, aad affiifflcd 14

This must have been the time for Arphaxad‚ the great¹
patriarch of the Hebrew family, to begin to exert himself—-to
form that resolution, make that declaration, and undertake
that enterprize which gave him the name of the Restm-er or
lie-aler of the 0’715212.

This ‹lesign he may have carried into effe& by forming a
confederacy with his brethren‚ and attacking the subjecis of
Nimrod in open war. And it is pretty clear, from some
allusions to this event, in the old testamcut, as well as from
the general language of mythology, that the confusion ot·
tongues was not the only means employed sor the breaking
up of the rebellious kingdom. The Lord confounded their
language, and they qut off to build the city: and then, tha
Lora scetem-ecl tlzemsmm thence.

ln other passages of scripture, the Lord is said to have
scattcred his enemics, when he discomfitted them before the
armies of his servants. The same external means seems to
have been employed upon this occasion, accompanicd perhaps
‘with an awful conflict of the elements. It was in war that.
the Gods and sons of the Gods scattcred the Giants,‘ from the
lieap they were raising, or burietl them under its ruins.
