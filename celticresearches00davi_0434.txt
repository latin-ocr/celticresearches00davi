Greece, and Reme, for much of its learning, has 1001111-

It may be expected, that I should here take some notice
of 1110 species, 111 written l‘mgu 1σο which have generally
been considered as totally (115 tinet from the use of ele
mentary alphabets. I mean, the Clzdinesc char-actas, and
the Ε( gzsp fian ltieroolyplziCS. Ι hope that my short ‘remarks
upon these topics, 11111011 111110 neither been the subject of
lny immediate studies, nor 111110 milch connection nith my

general plan, 11111 bc accepted with candour, as merc grounds
of conjecture.

The characters of the Clunese ham no elementary con-
nection nith a language of that peonle, —and books, urit-
ten in these characters, may bc r'ead 111 50101111 languagcs
Their appearance 11115 impressed me with'a notion, that, ori-
ginally, they'were nothing but monograms of a pol-y,-
sylla liic language, very different from that of the Clzinese, and
that the keys, or radit-'al parts of these diameter-S, which
constantly preserve a relation to the 5111110 leading ideas,
whatever adventitious touches they have adopted, were
monograms of primitive words, which admit ofprepositions,
of terminations, and of other words, in composition.

The Chinesc, as I learn from Dr. Hager‚ have preserved
501110 remains, and much tradition, of 1111 earlier series 111
characters more complex, representing natural, or artificial
objecta, like the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians. The
people, who supplied their monograms, may have had
letters, designed after such objectes-as in the old Samari*
ta'n alphabet, already mentioned, ¹
