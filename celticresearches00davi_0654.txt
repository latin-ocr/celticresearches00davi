It appearsj that the Welslz are not the only tribe‘who
have preserved vestiges, like these, of the ancient western
religion.· I have already hazarded an opinion, that the
Armorican tongue has lineally descended from the Celti«-
⁰s Gaul, and that our Druidism flourished in Britan—31
to a late period.

lowing particulare* 2—-

1787, contends, that the Armorica„ is the genuine Celtic
of ancient Gaul, and but very little, if at 1111, affected by
the sister dialect of Bricish emigrunts.

demonstrated this fact, in his Origines Gauloises-Ham-
bourg, 1801 ;÷-a book, which merit*⁴ the peculial· attention
of Celtic anliqemrz'eS.

The ingenious, ancl weU-informed writer of the l'ogsagc

the same Opinion, but takes notice of Druidical eustoms,
traditions, and superstiti'onss, 111 that district, which to
