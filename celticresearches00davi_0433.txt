of the arts and sciences, derived from the family of Noah,
and, through them, from the antcd‘iluvians. They were,
therefore, the first who innovated on primitive systcms, and
who obliterated that impression of respect, which the in-

With antiquities of their own country, these more cele-
brated nations, in the meridiari of their learning, and

their instructors, as the original inventors of arts, and the
first communicators of science. ,Modern Europe, in like
