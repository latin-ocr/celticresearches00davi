ni Ξβτεὶῆεε.

I began to reason with myself thus :

‘⁶ A nation, comparatively rude, and sim-
ple, may have preserved the outlines of two, or
three, ancient, and primitive arts, with more
precision than otherS‚ who were ambitious of

innovationS, and refinements.

“ But, if the system be a genuine relic of
antiquity, it will abide the test of compa-
rison. Traces of it will be found in other
countrz‘es ,·—at least, those elements which are
intimated by the symbol& will find correspond-
ing affinities in the radica] terms of other lan-
guages‚ which are known to be ancient. The
system of Celtic speech is too ingenious to have
been struck out by the original contrivance,

or local accidents of the Celtic racd²

I made an experiment upon the languages

of Judea‚-—up0n those of Greece,-and of
Rome.
