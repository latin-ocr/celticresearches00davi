The learned have generally regarded the names of the
Hebrew letters, which corresponded with Chaldemz, ancl
Phoenician, as terms of significance, eonveying ideas, not
only of the characters themselves, and of their elementary
powers, but also of certain productions in the field of na-
ture or of art3 as aleph, an ox3—betlz, a lzouse 5—gimel, a
camel 5—daletlz, a door, stc. And it has been the opinion
of some very eminent scholam, thatocharacters of these
letters were, originally, intended for sketcbes of those ob-
jects, (or of their characteristical parts,) after which they

were named.

Of the original characters in the Hebrezv letters, we
cannot speak positively. The Chaldaic square characters

of this alphabet, we discover such plain drafts of certain
quadrupeds, advancing, and retreating, that the design
cannot be mistaken. See the Jod, and Tsadc, Daret.

The opinion, therefore, that the old Asiatic letters were
drafts of certain objeets, cannot be entirely faneif1113 and
the infert-nee will be, that such letters possessed, in part,
a't leazt„ the nature of hieroglyphim, or general symbols,
like those of the Celta:;—an‹l were intended, equally to
convey certain ideas, besides their elementary powers in

language.

But, though each of the Clmldaic, Samaritam, or Phoe-
nia-ian characters, may have originally represented some
object, yet no copy of them, which is known at present,
enables us to slay that all of them can be described, or un-
derstood, as representing objects of any one class. They
