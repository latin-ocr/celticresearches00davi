The subjec‘ks of Nimrod included a great proportion of the
human racc. They were strong and they were confident*-¹
How greatly must their strength have bccn rcdnccd, and the-ir
confidence dampcd, at the approach of battle, when an evil
conscience, awakcncd by ihc voice os thundcr, shook their
imnost frames, and a supernatura] panic- convulscd the organs
of spccch, so that they could uttcr only unformcd sounds, and

beginning to bussd must not be mistaken for Bab-ylen the

records only the names of the nations thcy rospcotively

au iuter-val of two οι· three geum-uriom, or about the space of
a century, (by the scale in Gen. xi.) gained an 'ascendcncy
over tho house of Cush. In the 4th degree from Noah vso
