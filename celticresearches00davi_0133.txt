nageable in oral tradition: and the precise length of mens'
lives, and their age at the birth of their children, are circum-
stances not likely to have been the subje& of immediate
revelassion to Moses. Yet his history of the primitive world
preserves an unbroken chain of chronology, from the creation.

Sacred and profane writers have mentioned an ancient mode
of recording facis by means of nails fixed in pieces of timber
or notches cut in sticks3 but if these customs were capable os
preserving historical fads, connetsted with their dates, foi-25
centuries‚ we must regard them ας, in some manner, equiva-

in the ensuing essayS, that this was the case.

The enumeration of circumstances, in the history of the
deluge‚ clearly points out the early use of letters, or of some-
thing equivalent to letters.

Here we have upon record, the particular month, and the

Here again, Moscs records not the phaenomena of the

been seen and observ-ed by Noah. He does not teu us upon
