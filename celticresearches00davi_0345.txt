Gwern, blaen llin,

of the lzazel, and the privet, of equal length, tied up with

oalc lt‘az·cs.’' And in Buartlz Beirdd, or the Circle qs the
Βανιῖε, the following remarkable passage occurs—-

WVyv llogell cerdd, wyv ll'e‘enydd:
Carav y gorwydd a gorail clyd,
A bardd a bryd, ni phryn ired.
Nyt ev carav amrysoniad:

A geibl celvydd ni meuedd mecld‘
RIadws myned i’r ymddiod,

A chelvyddeid, am gelvyddyd,

A chanclwm, cystwm Cyzc*lad.*

“ Ι am the depository of song3 I am a man of letters:

I love the sprigs, with their woven-tops secured,

And the Βανά who composes,xvitl1011t purchasing his liquor

I love not huns-the framer of strife:

He that reproaches the skilful, possesses no mead.

lt is time to go to the banquet,

With the artists employed about their mystery‚

With a EUNDRED KNOTS, after the manner qs'om· coun-
