vare, also, clearly re-eehoed, in the names which are given to
the lots os Druida'sm, or the omen. sticks of Britain.

We may venture, then, to assert, that, whilst thc Romans
>'imitated the arrangement, and characters, of the Ionian
alphabet, they cherished, and preserved, for the mom,
part, the simple, and the original names of their national
letter53 viz. the Arcadian, or Pelasgian, of Evander, the
same as the Etruscan, the Celtic, and primitive letters of
‘Europa

With such names, perhaps, all nations had been once ac-
quaintcd. Even the Heln-ew alphabet is not without simpie
-names, corresponding to the marked, and specific ones of
the Pelasgian, or Bardic alphabet3 as He, in the Pe-
lasge'an, or Bardic, E, which denotes, in Celtic, that
‘per-son, tlzat thing, as the Hem-eze, &⁹17 ; Pe,—-in the Bardic,
stis-a healf, or slearp point‚—as the chrezc ΠΕ).

'she names of some letters, in the modern Greek alpha·
bct, prove, that this people had known letters of different
powers, distinguished by simple names, Υ must have been
called (Jpstilon, slendcr U, in contradiction to that broad
U, which is found in the Roman, the Pclctsgian, thc Irislz,
{he Bcw’clic, and the Runic alphabc-ts 3—-but not in the Ionian.

So again: removing from Epsilon, Upsilon, Omicron,
and Omega, the epithct Psilon, sslicmn, and BIegn, which
constitute no part of the wal names, we discover the sim-
ple enuntiation„= of the vocal p‹)wers,—-—·E, O, U, as in the
Pelasgiau, Roman, and ,Bardic alphabctS.

lt remains, to shcw the cm·res÷pondence of the Pelasgian‚
as well us the Ionian, with Druidical alphabcts, as far 88
may demonstrate their common origin.
