brutes, with all their various languages, impres-sed an apti*
tude upon them, to utter certain perceptions, by their cor-
responding sounds, and that he denied all such predisposing
aptitudes to man alone?

Something of this kind seems to be intimated, when I am
told, that orations of savageS, or of men in a stat-e of
nature, have not yet surmounted the difficulty of pronoune-
ing several consonants. However conclusive such 1111 ar*
gument may appear, to some philosophers, l confess, that
for one, Icannot perceive its force, or grant the assump-
tion, that savtzge life, is a natural state, or, that extreme
depravity, and the ultimate perfeetion of the human crea-
ture, can be one and thc same thing. A natural state is
that which affords the best and fairest opportunity, for a
display of the discriminative character, of this or that
species: and the characteristic of man, is reason, or com·
mon sense. The condition, which affords the best and fair-
est opportunity for the exerc-ise of this endownlent, is the
natural and perfect state of man. Examine that plant!—-—it
grows in its proper soil, and congenial aspect. There it
will be found in its natural state. From that state, it may
be equally removed, if pampered in a hot-bed, or starved
in a cold steril earth. So man departs as widely froin his
nature, by the path of rudeness and brutality‚ as by that of
luxury and refineinent. His intellectual, and his organic
faculties, may be infinitely debased, below the intention
and standard of nature.

If this be the situation of savageS, I can acknowledge no
more force, in the argument before us, than in that of a
philopher, who should reason with 1116 thus. ‘-‘ 1111111113,
