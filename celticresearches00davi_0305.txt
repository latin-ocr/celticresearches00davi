An acquaintance with old orthography of the Welsh,
joined with some knowledge of the Irislz, or Gaelz'c, will
qualify me to offer a version, which, as Ι think, is not wide
ostruth. The subject appears to be this :—A principal
officer, in a household, or a garrison, describes his de-

 

jection, during the absence of a chief. It is not clear,
whether he gives his real sentiments‚ or intends a com-
piiment.

“ Spiritless (as Ι am) I will not study profit, this night,
My househo]d are not valiant——
,Ι will put away the caissdr011.²’“
The bard shall not sing3 Ι will not laugh: Iwill not feast,
this night.
Let men of renown drink mead together!
I will put away the pam*
Let no one meddle with mirth, this night,
Til] my supporter comes down:
[WVhen] my Lord comes, we shall feast to the full.’'

(l) I. Gor, profit; Cos, consideration3 Cosam, to study.
(Q) I. ⁷Neumh, a negative particle in composition3 Εοηατεφ,

⁸ The cauldron, the pau, used in preparing the feast.
