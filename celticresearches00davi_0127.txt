But in this age, the art of writing could not have been a
recent invention. The engraving of names upon signets is
referred to, as a thing publicly known3 and surely, the first
essays in writing had not been made in precious stenes-—
Signets were used by the Israelites before they went down into
Egypt, and it is not improbable that they were inscribed.—
Their inscriptions must have been in simple el1a1·a6te1·s, adaptcd
to the subject and the space which the gems afl'orded3 whereas
the letters in general use in Egypt seem to have consisted of
the representatione, of animals, and other productioris of nature.
In some ord Asiatic alphabetS, we still discover letters in the
figures of certain quadrupedS, and exaeily similar to some ot*
the hieroglyphics on the Egyptian obelisks. Such characters
may have been liable to abuse, amongst a people so prone to
idolatry as the Israelites were, and for this reason, it may have
been commanded that the more simple alphahet ot'the en-
graver of signets should be used in preference.

In the book of J ob, we find the antiqnity of writing asserted
in a manner no less positive. In one passage, that illustrious
sufferet complains, “ Thou writest bitter things against me,
and makest me to possess the iniquity of my youth!² ln
another, he exelaims, “ Oh! that my words were now written,
Oh! that they were printed in a book! (stamped, as on the
Babylonian b1·icks?)—-that they were graven with an {ron pen
and lead in the rockfor cver!” Here writing is not spoken of
as a new invention. It must have been an art long established,
before its various forms, uses and properties could have been
so well understood. In the time ofJob, it was applied, as at
present, to the taking of minutes of trivial circumstances or
wrz'ting (ψ’ bitter things ‚- the recording of greater events in
books, and the preserving a lasting memorial of what is
very remarkable, in public inscriptions. It must have been
one of those arts which are ascribed to the search of the fathers
