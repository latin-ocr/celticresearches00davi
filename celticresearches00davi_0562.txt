When we design to point out some particular object, in a
private manner, so as not to attract general observation, the
finger is not immediately directed to it, but held low,
and pointed towards the ground. The countenance inclines
downwards; the eye is directed below the object itsclf,
and sliadcd by the eyebrow. The same kind of action is
copied spontaneously‚ by the imitative organs of speech·
The point of the tongue drops downwards, and rests against
the lower tceth. The uppcr teeth close over it, as it were,
to conceal the unavowed design} and the lose, insiuuating,
hissiug sound of S, is produced.

This power, is, thereforc,·¹1mtu1·ally descriptive of secret
dizerimimztion, insinuativa, a privato madring, and dis-
tinguislciug. Consequently‚ it expresses those ideas of a
thing, with which such observation is generally made.
These may sometimes be connected with owe, and respect,-
but, more generally, with contempt, scorti, or some. insidious
