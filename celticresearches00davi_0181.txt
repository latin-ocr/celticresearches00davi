pernes of light, beat, air, spirit, atti-anion, motion of the
heavenly bodies, &cn it occurs to me that, if the Hebrew
language was at once delivered to Adam, he must either have
possessed a language which he could not possibly have under-
stood, or else he must have been ininiitely instruelzed in the
most refincd philosophy, and ,the most hidden seerets of
nature: both which l think equally improbable.

Thai any living language, whatsoever, should have re-
maincd in the same state, i'romflie Cre-alien, to the time of
Moses, is a thing in itself of the utmost improbability. During
this period of 2500 years, human society had undergone the
greatest changes imaginable. It had began in one simple,
inexperienced family, whose ideas-and knowledge of things,
and consequently, whose occasion for a variety of words was
daily progressive. It had afterwards expandcd into large
communities, and divided into powerl'ul states, had been
adorned by the acquishion of asts and scicnees, and diversi-
fied by the various habits, pui‘suits and situations of life. A
second time it had been reduced to a single family, and a
second time had enlarged itsclf, under the like variety of
circumstances. Had no occasion occurred, during such an‘
eventful interval, for the introdue‘tion of new ternis and
phrases„ or the affixing new meanings to those already iu
use?

Without a continual= suecession of miracles, it is impossible
to imagine one vernacular idioni as still remaining, under
these cii·cui11stanceS‚ unalterable in its sti-uelum, its gimnmar,
the mode of its pronunciation, and the extent of its voeabu-
lary. Before we admit that any such thing ειξωειΠ)ν hap·-
pcned, it is but reasonable to examine the proofs upon which
the fae} is supposed to rest. >
