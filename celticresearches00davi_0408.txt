From the identity of the general name, by which the
Celtic, and Runic letters are distinguished ; from the iden·
tity of the radicat number in both, (sixteen) and the general
agreement of their powers; from the identity of the uses to
which they were applied, the similarity of several charac-

stoek, and were devised upon the same plan, or system.

Yet, we must not suppose, that characters of Ger-

from the language of all Rmzic inscriptions: “ The
Northern Gotlzs held their letters in the highest reverence,
—ascribed the invention of them to their chief deity—and
attributed even to the letters themselves, supernatural virtues.''
A veneration so bigotted‚ and superstitious, demonstrates,

The exclusive property of a Rzmic alphabct, is awarded,
in 11 manner, to the Gemmas, by the Celtae themselves.
