‘W'hen so great a partos the human raee had conspired to
resist the execution of the Divine mandate, we must suppose
that the families who still respected the authority of the
patriarch, began to repair towards their allotted habitations,
under the (lirefftion of Noah, his· sons and their obedient
children. The fathers of families considered their respective
portions of the earth as their proper estate, and the inlieritanee
oftlieir offspring: it must then have been a leading object
with them to take personal charge of their lots. They were
not sent forth to explore regions absolutely unknown and
undiseovered. Noah and his sons must have had some
knowledge of the regions of the earth, as sar as they had
been known and inhabited before the flood. In the act of
partition after the flood, they must have described their
boundarics. The patriarehs who took possession of'the larger
divisions must afterwards liare assigned to their children their
due proportions. So that in an age or two after the first
partition, every region of the known world, which was
adapted to the support and comfort of human society, must
have received that gerino which gradually expanded into its
primitive nation: and thus Spain, and even Britain were
probably eolonized by those who were born within a century
,Of the deluge.
