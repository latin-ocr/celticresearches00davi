I'n the cultivation of dialectS, through all their stages,
this principle has, for many centuries, been overlooked,
and its traces, have, in some degree, been obliterated. In-
flections‚-mutations,-and other novel terms, have re-
ceived the sanction of custom, and the authority of grain-
marians, without the least practical reference to the voice
of nature. Still the vital principle itself is perceived, and
is acknowledged by authors, and by readers who are blessed
with an accuracy of taste. It may be remarked, in the un-
solicited expressionS, which accompany our natural efforts,
or emotions‚——-and in the radical words of most languageS.

The opinion which I have thus maintained, has nothing
at all new in it, The very same doctrine appears to have
been the general persuasion of remote antiquity, and was
never shaken, till the history of man was abused by sablo,
aud thei-r maxims confused by philosophical quibbles.

The Egyptians are acknowledged by all to have carried
minute inquiry, founded on experiments, to as high a pitch,
as any inhabitants of the ancient world.

Amongst them, an original formation 'of language, from
spontaneOuS, and from natural soundS, was received as a
general axioni, from which there could be no appeal. This
appears, from an experiment, made, by a king of Egypt,
for the purpose of determining the comparative antiquity
of the nation he governed. T τεο ivgf'ants, zello, from the
birth, had not been suffered once to hear the voice of
man, ac the end oftzco years, uttered spontaneously α term,
which, in Phrygiam sigui icd hread. From this incident,
the Eg ptiaus concluded, that Phrygian was the most an-
cient lan gua ge.
