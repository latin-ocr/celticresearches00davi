These characters distinguish the Celtic from the Gothic,
and most other languages.

The roots are very simple. A single vowel, or a diph-
thong, not only forins a particle, as in other languages;
but frequently a noun, and a verb. There are few, if any,
combinations, consisting of a single primary consonant, fol-
lowed by a vowel, or diphthong, or of any consonant, pre-
ceded by a vowel, or dipthong, which have not their mean-
ing, and which do not even preside at the head of a nu-
merous family. Into such roots as these, we can resolve
the longest words that are purely Celtic.

The roots, must not be considered as absolute, or fixed
names of objects; as earth, water, tree, stone, ἕςε. but as
the expressions, or marks of leading ideas; or as deseribing

certain modes of existence, or of operation, which present .

themselves to our senses: and therefore, as agreeing‚ so
far, in their nature, to the roots of the Heb⁷·etc‚ as they are
developed by the learning, and genius of Part-lamet.

Thus, for example, the Irish Ur, signifies, a covering over,
a spreading upon. Hence it is transferred by them to a va-
riety of objects, &c. in which this image presents itself; as
would, earth, fire, water, ver-dure, heatlc, evil, slauglzter,
brave, very, 350.
