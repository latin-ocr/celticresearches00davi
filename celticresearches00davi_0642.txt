haps their mutation amongst themselves was the first con-
fusion that language underwent. ι

The substitution of the privative E for the positive A, and
vice versat, might, of itselt', have answered the desigu of
the confusion at Bahel.

I have shewn, that Herma-s, and Greeks, the old inha-
bitants of Italy, and the Celtic nations‚ were peculiarly
caret‘ul to distinguish each of their elementary sounds, by
a descriptive name, or to represent it by some natural, and
c'm1·acteristieal object 3—that. names and symbols, of each
individual power, evidently pointed at the same image, in
all these languages.

From thence I inferred, that an age, however distant
froin ours, once existed, in which the ancestors of all these„
nations had a distinct perception of the force denoted by each
of their primitive sounds, and when they regarded that
import as marked by nature itself.

As the peculial· correspondencc, or the natural affinity
between certain munds, and certain ideas, ‚was admitted
so generally by ages thus remote, I made a further in-
duction‚ that primitive man acted upon the general prin-
ciple of natural expression, in assigning to each of the
elementary sounds, its peculial· province in the formation

of language.
