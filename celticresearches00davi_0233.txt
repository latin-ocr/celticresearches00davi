This great Bard was born in Cis-Alpine Gaul, and seems,
in his youth, to have courtcd the Gaulish Bluse, till hc found
that she would not advance his fortune—-a very unpocticul

ground of desertion—-

Galatea reliquit:

 

Namque—fatebor enim—dum me Galatea tenebat,
Nec spes libertatis erat, nec cura peculi.

a Galatea was the mother of the Celtaefi Appiam Bell. 11‘1512

Tho same poet mentions the Gallicum Tan, in a passage of
his Catalcffla, which Ausonius, the Gaulish Bard, proposes
as an {enigma to his learned friends. This Tau was the
symbo] of the Dru-idical Jupiter. It consisted of a huge,
giant oak, deprived of all its branches, except only two large
oneS, which, though cut off and separated, were suspended
from the top of its trunk, like extended arms&

whether, from these passage5‚ we do, 01· do not infer that
Virgil had studicd in the mysticism of Druid lore, he, at
least, intimates clearly, in the Six1h AEncid, that he was
touching upon Druidical mysterieS.

It was necessary the hero should obtain a branc-h of
misseltoe, as the means of his introduftion to the court (gf
Plato. The poet minutely describes this plant, but instead of
risking a ful's explanation, by fixing· its name, he says iz
resembled the misselcoe.

Discolor unde auri per ramos aura refulsit,
Qale solet sylviS, brumali frigore, viscum

’ἢ See Borlase p. 108, fot the authorities.
