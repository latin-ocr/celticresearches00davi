Conditz'ons os men in primitive society—The separation qs tlte*
Noackidae.

THE same hypothesis which regarded man, in his pri-
mitive and natural state, as placed extra civitatem, or in the
condition of an unconne6³ted savage, has furnished occasion
to some late theotists to contend for the Rigkts omez, to
insist upon an equality of condition, and to assert the unlawe
fulness of every degree of authority, which has not *been
personally acknowledged or virtually conceded. I must
confess myself not so much of a philosopher οι· politician as
to perceive the principles upon which this doctrine can be
maintained.

If all the children of nature have an equa] claim to her
bounty, then the brute creation, eveiy thing that breathes,
must be placed upon an equal footing with mankind.

If a mere endowment with reason constitute a title to
pre-eminence, then women and children must rank with rnen,
not only in an equality of condition, but in an immunity
from all contronl which is not concedcd, and in the right
of delegating or cxci-eising authority.

If the prerogativc of man be urged, upon the plea of
superior mental powers, it must be recollthed that men differ
from each other, in this respect, no less than in the established>
gradatione, ol' society.
