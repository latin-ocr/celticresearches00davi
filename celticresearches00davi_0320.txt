Avienus had seen: that, in that journal, the Islands of
Britain are mentioned, ⁴by :die name of Oestrymnidcs,
[slands infested by the Oestrum, or Gadfly. Bleur. ib.
P. 275.Ἰ From Boclz. canaan, L. i. C. 35, 39.

With Boclzart's leave, I must remark, that JIamilco’s
diseovery„was rather of the *S'Cl'lljl Islands, than of Britain,
and that it was only after tlte discovery zetas made, that
either Tartesians, or Cartlmgz'nians had visited gthem, for
the purpose of trade. They found the natrices rich in tin,
as well as in lead, and addieted strenuously to eommerce,
which they had carried on in their national vessels.

Turbidum late fretum,

 

 

Et belluosi gurgitem occ-:ani secant

 

 

rei ad miraculum,
,Navigia junctis semper aptant pellibus,
Corioque vastum saepe percurrunt salem.

Avienus, quoted in Camden's Cessiteridos. Ed. Gibson.

The barks, covered with skins, that served them to na·-
vigate the rouglz. chamuel, aud the guff qf tlte raging ocean,
were Britislz, 01· Celtic barks. The natives, theu, had been
the curriers from the Cassiteridas, which foreigners had
known hitherto by fame alone, and by their produce3 but
which Herodotus, who wrote about forty years before the
voyage of Παηῑὶίεο, knew not where to find.

' whether the Cartlmginiau added the ‘'Cornislt promon-
tories to his discoveries or no, the name, and the etymology
of Oestrymnidcs constitute a whimsical blunder‘in trans-
lating from Brilislz. Cle‘r, means Gadflies: but observe
:mother meaning ostile word. ‘⁸' Εἶὲν, The teuchers.
