A mysticism similar to that of the Druids, appears to have
prevailcd, amongst the W estem Cimmerii or Celtae, from the
remotest antiquity.

Some of their most prominent features were—the. intercourse.
they held with 501115, after death—”the judgment which ‘they'
passed on the actions of men, and the inference they drew,
from their lives, respecting the changes *they would undergo,
and the mode of their ultimate renovation.

In the court qf'Pluto, which always 'held its judieial seat,
in the land os the Celtae or Cimmerii, causes of this kind were
determined by incorruptible Judges, and there could be no
higher compliment paid to the most sacred characters, than to
enrol them into this high trust of J udicature. W'e read of
three personages' thus promoted, each of whom appears, from
his'birth, from his place of nativity, and from the history of
his life, to have been eminent as a Κοης.

ἎἯΕΠ Homer sends Ulysses to consult the dead, he (locs
not make him touch upon the celebrated shores of Egypt or
Phoenicia, though he had sailed by them. He directs him to
the coast of the IVestcrn Ocean—to Portugal or Spain—to the
land of the Cimmerii or Celtae, and the Dominions of Pluto
or Dis, whom the Celtae acknowledged as their father. In
this devious course, the poet must have been guided by
ancient and prevailing opinion.

The deseent of AEneas into the Regions below, in which he
learns the mysteries of the BIetemp-sycltosis, the fortunes—the
changes—the renovations of his descendants—Dochines of
pure Druidism—is from a part of Italy, in which, not only
the researches of Strabo, but, perhaps, Virgil himself placed
one branch of the Cimmerii.
