tions, and, therefore, must have been essential parts of
those. very gestures, or descriptions. It must follow, that

Those corresponding sounds would soon have obtruded
themselves upon the notice of the first parents,—-have super·
seded the use of elaborate gestures,—and have become the'

current medium, for the reciproca} communication of their'
ideas.

The force, and the expression, of¹ the other letterS, I
shall have occasion to examine hereafter. The articulations
of C, G, P, and T, have been classed, amongst the more
difficult, and less obvious. What Ι have said of them wil}
suffice, to shew, that a faculty of articulating may be
ummah—and that sounds may have appropriate relations to
the ideas, which the mind intends to eonvey.

All expressions of the human voice,-—the modulative‚-==
the vocal,-—0rthc articulate, are not, therefore, as many have
supposed, mere imitations of that which has been heard,—

tural affinitics.

There are soundS, naturally descriptiva· They are
produced unconsciously, by the various impressions that are
felt, and are calculated for communicating the same im-
pressions, to those who hear them. As they undoubtedly
entered into the root of thefirst languagc, they retain thei!
places, inore, or less. in the various dialects, which have
branchcd from this original stem.
