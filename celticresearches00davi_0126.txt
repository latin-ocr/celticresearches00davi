But the context is decisive. Moses built an altar (in Rephi-
dim) and called the name of it Jehovah-Nissi3 for he said,
‘⁵‘ , ηἐαιιεε tlte Lord ΙιατῘι steorn, that the Lord will have war
with A1nalcl-:, from generation to generation. Moses knew,
therefore, what was ineant by α Book, and was acquainted
with the nature of BIemorials, the art of nursing, and of
Rcading or rehearsing out of memorials, before the delivery
of‘the sacred tables. A gain (Ex. xxviii.) Moses is commanded
to take two onyx stones and grave upon them the names of
the children of Israel—-“ With the work τ) 'an engraver in
stone, 1211<E the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the
two stones, with the names of the children of Israel.’' In the
same chapter, he is further commanded to engrave twelve
stones, with the names of the children of 1³1 πε] according to
llzeir names, like the engravings of a signet. In these passagcs
we have a constant reference to a well 717an η art of engraxing
n ames upon signets; and these eno-xraxings cannot be rewarded
as cyphers or mere'hieroglyphical symb0133 for (v. 36) we find
another command to make a plate of pnre gold, and grave
upon it, like the engravings ofa signet, “ IleLINESS TO
THE LORD.” This cannot possibly mean any thing else
than zcriting in words and in Letters: and all thesc'com-
ulands were giren, before the firs't tables were delivered.

Itis then an indisputable fuel, th· nt bools or memori la· in
wrsting, and consequently reading, uere things nell under-
stood before the giving of the s ·crcd t2‘1bles. These t·1bles
certainly consisted of alphabetico] writing, and the preceding
inscriptions were undoubtedly of the same kind, and in tlte
same ‹·lc(1r(152c1·. Otherwise the introdncffion of a new and
sacred mode of writing must soon have rendered the former,
and less perfect mode obsolet03 and the names upon the genis
and ihc golflen plate must hare become obscure and unintel=
ligible.
