The strongest argument which I know, in‘ favour of the
incorruptibility of the Hebrew language, is drawn from the
book of Genesis, where Moses intimates a derivation of the
names of some persons and things, in the- first ages, from
Hem-ew words. From hence, it has been infened, that this
language must have been used in the first ages, otherwise it
could not havev formed the basis of the said names. But
the derivation of a few terms can only prove, at most, that
the Hebrew retained the general principles of the primi-
tive language. It does not follow that these principles had
not been abundantly unfoldcd, and variously combined and
, diversified‚ during the progr-ess of ages. The English language
may furnish us with the true reason for many names and
terins, in the old Gothic and Anglo-Saxon. Thus perhaps,
the character of Lol.- the capricious god of the Goths is best
explained by our familiar English Luck‚· yet, upon the whole,
our present tongue is a very different thing from these ancient

dialects.

It may be urged further, that every name which admits of
derivation, must originally have had a distinet meaning. lt.
must bave been given for some particular reason. It could
not have been a proper or absolute, but a relative or descrip-
tive term: Not a name, but an epithet. And it is not only a
natural and obvious, but a customary thing sor an historian to
translate the titlcs and epithets of men and things, into the
Ianguage of his narrative. Moses perceived that the names of
our first parents and of their descendants had their meaning,
and were given for some certain reason. He may have
judged it necessary that the meaning should bc preserved and
that the reason should appear. The names upon record may
then be regarded as the Heb1·cw‚ rather thau as the primitive
nameS.
