Ι would just observe, in this place, that, in the course of
my essay, no labour of mine has aimed at the support of
any one preeonceived hypothesis. My opinion is not what I
brought with me, to the reseamh, but what has been the result
of inquiries. It was gradually formed, and was impressed,
by the force of evidence. I aim at no conceit of invention.
My utmost pretension is, to re-discover what has been long
concealed, by collecting facts, which, for many centuries,
have been preserved in an insulated state. In every period and
stage of the disquisition, Ihave adduced what appears to
me competent evidence. My witnesses t00, (so far from
having been capable of collusion,) were not eonscious of
each other's existence3 yet, their testimony so well con-
nee-ts, appears so consistent with itself, in its various parts, and
in the general sum, that I cannot hesitate in concluding-—
it is the evidence qf truth.
