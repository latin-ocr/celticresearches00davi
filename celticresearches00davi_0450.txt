there are» ten words for a boy 5—upwards of twenty, for a
hill, or mountain 3——and as great a variety, for almost every
object, which an unrefined people, were likely to have con-
templated3 but each of them describes a distinct relation,
or character, of that which it names.

¹ We cannot, therefore, adduce the diversity of terms, as
an argumente-arram& the first principle of natural expression,
and the original identity of languages,-——till we have con-
sidered these terms, in the relative, and the descriptiva:
capacity, not in the fixed, and the absolute.

That mankind have an aptitude, and fax-ourite impulse,
to lcarn sounds by the ear, is rcadily admitted. It is a sub-
ject of daily observation. The infant thus acquires the
language of its nurse, as the youth does that of the fo-
reigner. The dialect of a nation thus becomes general,
throughout the several families.

It is further admitted, that a mode of articulation, which
is acquired by the infant, appears, for ever afterwards, the
most natural, and the most easy to us; whilst the sounds
taught at a more ach-anecd agc,'are practised with com-
parative difficulty.

By the ear, and frequent efforts, some have learned 3-
-—-“ liquidas avium voces imitarier ore.”

to uttcr sounds with ease, and fluency, that would be found

impmcsscable, upon the first attemptae—-Some kinds of birds,

on the contrary, have imitated the songs of the· other spe«
cies, or the articulation of the human voice.
