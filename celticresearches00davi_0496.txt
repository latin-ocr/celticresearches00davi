nitherto remarked, had their use, in supplying copious ma-
terials, for the construction of language‘, and in afl'ording an
opportunity, for the discrimination of termS. As the se·
condary powers were eaSily refer-able to their prhnitives, no
confusion could arise froin their use. ⁷

But the love of ease is too prone to degenerate into
vicious indolence. The organs of speech, were suffered,
occasionally, to hang back, so far from the point of con-
tact, that they could no longer vibrate a distinct intimation
of the intended power. Only a kind of obscur-ely vocal, or
liquid sound was produced; 01· brcath escaped, either in total
silence, or with a mere aspiration. Thus, in pronouncing
B, or M, the lips are brought into complete contact. If
the contact be imperfect, these powers change to V .· if the
lips rest further apart, these powers vanish, in the obscure
U, which is not heard, when mixed with other sounds, in
rapid utterance.

Let us proceed, in like manner, with the other articu-

Th, and H,· D into ch, and a soft breathing3 N into a

or χ, and into H‚· G into Gla, and Y, and then into a soft„

This careless mode os utterance, which may be called the
solution of sounds, has occasioned confusion of elemen-
tary powers, which ought uniforinly to be distinct3 as the
obscure U, for J} und M, and Y for G. It has also made
thc aspirato II, a common representative of several articu-
