the full possession of all their bodily, and of all their intel-
lectual, faculties, unexercised, indeed, but mature, and per-
fect, and with every possible aptitude for exercise. They
were endowed with a native impulse, which directed all
their powers to their proper ench—and tney had no savage
habits to overcouie.

Such a distinction ought, unquestionably, to be made,
could we give implicit, and full, credence to the facts, re-
lated of these two savages. But these facts demand a very
serious reconsideration. Common sense has a voice, more
persuasive than is that of a hundred philosophers. In this
instance, do we not hear it rebuke us, sor drawing such nu-

to me an utter impossibility, I suppose, that, if there be
not some philosophical fraud in their history, these two
savages, notwithstanding their near approach to the human
form, were half brutes, the offspring of abomination. In
