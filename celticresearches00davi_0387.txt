the wisc men of Egypt being deceived in their divinations,
and declares,—“ Neithcr shall there be any work for
Egypt, which the head, or mil, branc-lc, or rusb, may

cation, thc rods, or the arrozcs, were marked, or inscribed,
like the German [οἴει they were no longer viewed, in
themselves, as symbols of the distinct ideas.
