δεῦτ’. V. On the formation qfan Aphaka, upon the
principle of general Symbols.

THAT such a system of symbol& conveyed‚ in its ori-
ginal state, and primitive application, the ideas of things,
and their several relations, has been shewn3 but it has
not yet appeared, how it was connected with definite
words, or with elementary sounds. Thus, by aleas, or
sprig of the nale, Druias, in the act of divination, may
have collected, and communicated, (amongst others of the
order‚) an image of spreading, expansimz, or wgfolding:
sprz'gs, or leaves of the asp, might present the image of
removing, waverireg, flatterz'ng, or inconstancy; but sym-
bols like these, in the light we have hitherto contemplated
them, may have had no affinities with one, more than
another, os the synonymous terms, and may have had no
relation to the elementary sounds of any term whatsoever,
Thus far, then, a system of language by symbols, may have
been totally different, in its nature, from alphabetical
writingss It may have been purely hieroglyphical. But the
art, as it may be ascertained, by the evidence of the same
authors, did not rest here.

The system, considered as Druidical, had attained such
a degree of perfection, that the same hieroglyplzical
sprigs‚ were become the symbols of sounds, as well as of
things, or of their several relations 3-—and that even deline-

ations of them had been constituted into a regular al„
phabct.
