epithets, magor and μεγα, amount to nothing more than the
simple Bardic name of this clement.

The H ehrew γ has been regarded as a consonant, reprc-
senting the sound of ug, gn, &e. and it has been variously
rendered, in proper names, by the translators of the
Bible into Greek. It may hence be conjectured, that
it generally retained a strong aspimtion, and that its vocal
power was obscure-ly uttered, during the latter ages of the
Jezcisla nation.

There are, however, grammarians who acknowledge it,
as a vowel, equivalent to o, and this opinion is confirmed, by
its place in the alphabet‚ and by the frequent representation*
of it, in proper nameS, by that letter.

lts name νγ, Oin, which implies a spring, or fountain,
affords a stronger proof of its real identity with the Celtic
0.- for 110 object in nature can be more characteristical of
castiug, yielding, or putting forth—emanation, or prty'ec-
tion. In Dc Gabelirc‘s Mando Primitef, there is a
Plzoenician inscription, in which this letter seems to be in·
tended, us an image of the sun. lt is a circle, encompassed
with rayS.

In order to discover the force of y, in the structure of
Ichrt‘w te1·mS‚ I would first offer a few instances‚ in which
rit stands contrasted with t'i'xe positive R.
