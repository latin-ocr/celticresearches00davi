other. But tli'e alpii-abet of Cadmus does not appear to
have been taken from the Hebrew, or from any other,
which corresponded with it. In the time of Moses, who
was cotelnporary with Cadmus, the Hebreoes had already
twenty-two potestates, or letters3 the alphabet of Cadmus
was, as yet, in amore primitive, and simple state5 consist-
ing only of sixteen lettersa

That names of Greek letters 'are me're imitations of the
sounds, formed by the Ilebrew names, or by the lyricen, is
a very disputable point. It appears to me, that most of
them are old, and genuine, Greek worck, conveying similar
ideas to those of the corresponding names in the IIebrezc,
and retaining a similarity of sound, only so far as the
two languages had a radical connection between each
other. I shall endeavour to render this proposition more
clear in the sequeL

But the identity between some, at least, of the Ionian
characters, and the Pelasgian, or Etruscan, ofthe Eugabian
tables, and the similarity of others, demonstrate, that both
of these two alphabets have sprung from the same fountain.
And, it should seem, that a change was not introduced at
once, but gradually effected. In the celebrated Sigeum in-
scription, wc discover nearly equal resemblances of the
Pelasgian letters, and the Ionian.- it was, therefore, en-
gravedâ€š at a time, when the former were beginning to
yield with reluctance, and the latter were insinuating
themselves into their place.

But it would be easier to demonstrate the original identity
of these alphabets, than to point out, with distinct ac-
euracy, the changes introduced by the Ioniansr
