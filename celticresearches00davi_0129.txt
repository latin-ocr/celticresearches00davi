he has not an opportunity os adding this circumstance. His
design seems to have been, not so much to mark the antiquity
of the arts known in his time, as to preserve a memorial of
eminent persons3 more particularly in that family which was
now wholly cut off, from the face of the earth.

But why has not Moses mentioned, or alluded to ancient
writings, in some passage of his history before the xvii. chap„
of Exodus?

If it be certain that no such mention 01· allusion is made, it
may be replied that the subject may not have come imme-
diately in his way, and that it was not the custom of writers,
far less ancient than Moses, to be minute in quoting their
authorities.

But we are not certain that Moses has not both alludcd to,v
and expressly mentioned writings, of a (late long prior to his
own time. In the historical part of the sacred scripture, we
frequently find references to the authority of books which are
no longer extant. Such historial parts were therefore com·-
piled from the materials of earlier writers, and not communi⁶
cated to the authors of the present volumes, by immediate inspim
ration. It is sufficient in this case to believe, that the Divino
spirit direeted the judgment of these authors, and disposed

them to examine with diligence, and record nothing but the
truth.

The book of Genesis, if we except the account of thr-2
creation, consists of matter purely historical, or such as might
have come within the compass of human research, and have
been recorded in history. And Moses 110 where declares that
he derived it from any other source. No part of it is intro·
«luced with the solemn form, “ The Lord spalze unto Moses.‘’
