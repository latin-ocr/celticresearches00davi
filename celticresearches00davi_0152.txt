2. Nothing of the kind has been laid to the charge of the
Jews. The pious men who revised the sacred books after the
captivity‚ certainly used the best copies that were to be found.
Their transcripts were long preserved. The people after
this period never relapsed into idolatry. Their numerous
scribes must have deteeted error, and the mutual jealousy of
their sees exposed corruption. Beside, the lawgiver of the
house of Judah was under the care of a special providence till
the Shiloh came, and our reliance upon the authority of the
scriptures rests, in a great measure, upon the firm belief that
they have not been wilfully corrupted.

3. The half pagan Samaritans, who rejected a great part
of the sacred canon, may be supposed to have taken unwar-
ranted liberties with the books they retained, in order to
countenance their heathenish errorS. And it was an error os
the Heathens that during the second or Silver age men
remained with their mothers for 100 yearS, in a state of
infancy, which was succeeded by a short and infirm period of
manhood. Hesiod. Egy. και Hp. α’. v. 129. How contrary is
this to the purpose of Providence declared Gen. ix. 1.?

4. The very old and grey-lzeaded friends of J ob, about the
time of Abraham, repeatedly speak of men of a jbrmer age
(and whose term of life abundantly exceeded theirs) as still
existing. This could not have been the case upon the Sama-
ritan scheme of chronology3 but upon that of the Hebrew
text, it was a certain truth.

5. As the Samaritan copy does not add to the number of
generationS, but only retards the population of mankind, I -
cannot pers-eive how its chronology would remove the objection
mspeCUng the age of Peleg. If -the race was prolific at the
age of thirty, it must evidently have inereased as much in 100
