jects of Ariovistus, in Caesar’s time, were in the habit of
divining bg] lats. (De Bell Gall. i. 53.) They were of
course in possession of the ποίεε, or characters, employed
in that practice3 aud the Irislz would not have called them
Marcomannic, had they been altogether the same as the
national characters of the Celtae.

We may, therefore, consider the Remic letters of the
north, as only different sketches‚ or draughts, of the sym-
bolical sprigs, acknowledged by the Celcae, and we may
infer, as, Ithink, we must, that both nations, with some
accidental changes, derived the system from their common
ancestors. The northern copy is not so uniform, and sim-
ple, as the Bardic ,· but, at the same time, it presents marked
and venerable features of antiquity, which are verified by the
oldest inscriptions of Greece, aud Italy.

Let me now investigate the affinity between the Celtic
letters, and those of Greece, or of Rome. But I must
premise a little historical epitome of their alphabets, as far
as my information extends. Ancient authors tell us of two
distinct alphabetS, which, in different ages, were known to
the inhabitants of (ἔνεπε. The oldest of these was
called the Pelasgz'c, the Amic, the Argive, or the Ar-
cadian, from the several people, by whom it had been em-

or old Italian, (tlplzabet, which also was called Arcadian,
because it was brought, as they said, out of Arcadia into

The Pelasgi, from whom this alphabet receives its fa-
miliar title, were some of the most ancient inhabitants of
Greecc: but the name was not confined by historians
to that country, nor is it accurately known how far it
extended, or whence it arose. Learned men have oh-
