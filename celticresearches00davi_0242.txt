ln Britain, it continued longer still, as appears from the
Law of Canute—Prohibemus etiam serio—quod quis adoret
Ignem vel flavium, T orrens vel Saxa vel alicujus generis
arborum Ligna.——Willce'nS, Leg. Aug. δατ. p. 134.

These were not Roman or Gothic, but Celtic superstitious,
of Druidism.

He who is at all conversam with the remains of ancient
It'elslz literature, cannot be at a loss for the reason of these
prohibitory Laws. Our oldest authors avow the most pious
veneratior] sor the Druids——give themselves credit, as initiated
into their mysterieS, aud profess to delivcr their genuine maxims
and traditions.

As Druidc'sm had so many real, though concealed partizanS,
long after its public authority was abolished, may we not
suppose, that some attempts would be made, when the use of
the pen was no longer inter-dictent, to cherish and preserve its
most valuable relies?

This order, for instance, taught the people something of
their own history. The convcrsion of the native to the
Religion of Christ, could not have rendered that history
uninteresting. The pcople would naturally wish to perpetuate
some account of their ancient independence. Accordingly
we find, alnongst the oldest Wclsh manuscripts, many his-
torical notices upon the model of the Druidieal Tri-ads, and
purporting to be the rernains ol' Druidical ages,

Their contents furnish, in my opinion, strong evidence in
support ot rhen· autlreuticity. [cannot account for thern at,
