were either extirpated, or entirely removed. They seem, in
several parts, to have amicably incorporated.

The Cymrjs, acknowledge their obligation to many a
Caur, or C ὃν, for useful arts, for wholesome laws, and for
equitable governrnent: VVhere a mixture of their dialects
prevailed, we may reasonably conclude, that both people
were united. E. Llwycl,'3“' Arcleccol. P. 1221, furnishes a sin·
gular instance of this mixture, in some ancient triplets,
whose grammar approaches nearer to the Welslz, though
several of the words bc Gzeycldelian. I shall extract his
account of them.

“ The following is the ancient languagc of Britous in
the north of this Island, Ι found it in the first leaf of an
old Latin book, on decayed vellum, written in a Gwyddelian
hand, about one thousand years ago (now one thousand
one hundred) By the writing, and by a few more words
of the same language, I am certain, that the book has come
from Scotlctnd,· and I can also compute the age of the
manuscript. Ι know not, whether it is the language of the
Strath—Clzcycl Erimus, or of the Plebs, or old Caledonians.
It is the oldest, and strangest ‚Britislz I have yet seen. I do
not understand the aim, and meaning of the lines.''

By following, however, the sozmd of the letters, and the
connection of the words, lecycl endeavours to reduce them
into modern Wclslz 01·thography,—and there he leaves them.

These, are the lines in the original.
