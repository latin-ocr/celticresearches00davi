Babylon, for somewhat more than 19 centuries, before the
conquest of that city by Alexander. They had therefore
commenced from the very time when, agreeably to our chro-
noffigy, the sons of men first began to dwell in the land of
Shinar.

’ Before their removal into that country, they could have had
no* observations calculated for the latitude of Babylon, and
their date, from this very aera, absolutely proves that the
science was not the 'discovery of the inhabitants, but that they
brought it with them, from their former residence amongst the
mountains of Araiat, where the antediluvian astronorny had
already been adjusted to the circumstances of time and place.
An investigation and discovery of the principles of the science
must necessarily have preceded a series of just observations.

The antiqus‘y of this study may be inferred from the book
of Job, where several stars and constellations are mentioned,
sin connection with observations upon the seasons‚ and as parts
of the works of God, which had been pointed out by the search
of the great fat-hers of the human race.

The Mosaical years from the Crcution cannot, one wilh
another, have fallen much short of solar revolutionS, which
were evidently the measure of calculation in the time of Noah:
for the age of this patriarch rather exceeds an avarage of the
ages of hi‘s progenitor&

From their common ancestors then, the several nations may
have derived the rudiments of astronomy, and a pretty exacti
knowledge of the annual period. Difl'ertmtsocieties may, for
