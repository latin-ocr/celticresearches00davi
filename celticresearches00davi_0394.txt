And this hypothesis, perham, will help us to assign the
reason, for the following derivations of Κλαδος, a rod, show,
or tender branch, which forcibly point out the uses to
which those branelles were applied. Κλκδεω, Ι speak. From
the materials of which a. lzedge is composed, it is called,
Κληδος, hence κληδων, a good omen, κληδονιζεμαι, Ι proplzecy,
divine, or take an omen. Let us recollect, that sprigs

of the Celtic dialects, use the same term for a lot, and for
a rod, or stick, it may be conjectured, that κλαὲος οι· undo,-
arod, and κληξος a lot, were originally but one term, in
Greek, perhapS, κληόξος,-Ἑοι· Cledr, in Welsh, has the sense-
of rods for watling.

ίοῐε, as means of divination, like their neighbours, the

Germans, and the Celtas.

ladies, mistaking their general name, for a derivative,
sprung from the word μαινομαι, represented them as mad, or
furious, whereas, they were properly Μηκιδες, declarem, or

indicators.

The name comes from the general Europcan term, Mem,
