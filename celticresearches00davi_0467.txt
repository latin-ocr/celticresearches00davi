The formation of language‚ considered in the abstract,
is a surprising phenomcnon. It will, however, appear ac-

this principle. But, without any such principle in our
nature, the acquisition of speech must have been impossible
to man.

Till.we have recourse to this principle, etymology will
rest upon nothing. We may unravel compounds, or
derivatives‚ till we arrive at certain ternis, which are enigma-
tical, and whose precise, or primary import, cannot be sa-
tisfactorily explained.

But, let us once admit natural expression, etymology
will then, like every other legitimate science‚ rest upon a
solid ground. We shall be guided through all the various
inflections of language, back to nature itself; to that pri-
mordial impression, made, by the hand ofthe FIRsT MOVER,
and, consequently, as far as true philosophy durst advance.

As the various passions, movements‚ and perceptions of
the mind, without study, or forethought, predispose the hu-
man frume, to assume their peculi-ar attitudes, and impress
