their sacred gifts into the hand of strangers. It is in allusion
’ to some habit of this kind, that we have stipulor from stipula ,⁴
and, perhap3, Foedu3,foederis, from the Irish, Fodar, stram.

The ancient Britons, called HelmstraW, Cloig, from Clo,
a lock, a conclusion, a corfirmotion. They had also Belys,
from Beli, their Apollo. Reli seems to be derived from
Βαῖιι, to slzoot, spring, or issue.sbrtlc.-—-Ena÷geyo;.

IIerodotus having understood that it was the eustom of
the H yperboreans, to deliver their sacred gifts into Scythiam
hands, for the purpose of better forwarding them into
Greece, enquired from the Scoloti of Lictle T artur-gs, whom
the Greeks of his age eminently termcd Scythiam, respect«
ing the IIyperboreans. But neither could this branch of
theScytlzians, nor any of their neighbours, the Essedones
excepted, give the least account of them, and their trace
of them, in his opinion, amounts to nothing. It therefore is
clear, that no such people resided in the North East of Europe.

The Essedones, who had this imperfect knowledge of the
Hyperboreum, were, probably, an eastern branch of the
people who used the war chariot‚ called Esoedum, or Es-
sedon,- and this was the national distinction of the Sigytloe,*
or the Celto Scythiam, who occupied the Soutlz West os
Germany‚ as it was also of their unquestioned Relations, the
Eritislc Belgae.- which carries us to the North I‘Vest from.
Greece, and at once into contact with Celts, who were
professors of Drzcidism.

And it was to the North West, from Gmece, that we find
the region of the Hyperboreum lay.
