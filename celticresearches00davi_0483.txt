The very ancient language of the Chinese is oomprised,
at this day, in a few simple monosyllables, which are
equally nouus, and verbs. They form no compounds, and
they admit of no unmeaning pmfixes, or terminations. The
signs of cases, numbers, voices, moods, tenses, and per-
sons, are distinct words of known value. By their ar-
rangement, and by certain variations, in the tones of the
voice, these few, simple terms, can serve the purpose of a.
copious, and precise language.

The same articulate sound appears to com-ey but one
leading idea, throughout the several tones of it.

Thus Fu, prirnarily, signifies covering, which idea. is
thus diversified by the aceentsz—Fsc, a lzasband,- 1³22, to
help, orprotect3 Fa), a town; Fa, afatlzer5 Fit, to con·
ccal, or cover. Dr. Hager's Element. Char.

Other ancientlanguages border upon this degree of simpli-
city. Al} the native terms of the W elslz, and of the Irislz,
are fairly reducible to three or four hundred monosyllabic
roots, of the simplest form, frequently both noum, and
verbs.

Critics in the Hebrezo language, have declared their
opinion, that al] its roots were originally monosyllabie'* 3 and

that “ each Hebrew root has δεῖ one leading idea, or mean-
