5. Remarks, not unlike these, have been extended even
to the feathered race. I have read, that a male bird has
taken a convenient station, before the nest, in full view
of the young brood, having purposed teaching them his
power of song, by lessons, adapted partly to their several
capacities, and partly to their degrees of application 3—-that,
in general, the talents of the young birds open, at a very
tender age 3 but that, if they be removed from the nest im·
mediately after they are hatehed‚ they never acquire the
song of the parent at all. This has furnished an argument,
that even the songs of birds, are not inspired by natural

instinct, but acquired by the ear alone, and by observation
upon the manner in which the sounds are produced.

These are the chief arguments against natural expression,
which occur to my recollection. I shall offer something in

repl y to them all.

The various terms, by which the different languages ex-
press the same thing, may be partly solved, by the different
modes of inflection, of composition, 01· of contraction3
which custom has introduced into local dialects, and by
which, the same radical word has been so diversified, that its

identity cannot be immediately recognised. I shall give
an instance of this, in the term for mes morbo-‘s son.
