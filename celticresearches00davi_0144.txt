Of Nimrod‘s rebellion and apostacy-lee confusion qs* tongues
-The dispersion qf the Giants.

THE rebellion and apostacy of Nimrod and his adherents,
and the subsequent confusion of tongueS, and dispersion of
the children ofmcn from Babel, were undoubtedly events of
considerable magnitude, in the early history of mankind. To
these events the poets and mythological writers are full of
allusion; but the only plain details we have of them, are
contained in Gen. x. V. 8 to 13. and xi. v. 1 to 10.

From the former of these passages, we learn that Nimrod,
a grandson of Ham, began to be a mighty one in the earth,
and a mighty lzunter before the Lord, or a violent persecutor}
and that he began to found a kingdom in Babel and the neigh-
bouring country. From the latter passage, it may be colledted
that many oftlze children of men entered into his design, and
began to build themselves a city and a tower, and to make
themselves a name, for the express purpose of preventing the
separation of families; but that this enter-prize was offensive to
the Lord, who therefore overthrew it by a mir-acle, confoundcd
their language, and scattered thern abroad from thence upon

the face of all the earth.

May I offer a few thoughts upon the nature and consequence
of these events? Though Ι wish to form an accurate idea, how·
