We have it simply as a brief introduffion to the history of the
Israelites, and the promulgation of the law. Between the
several portions of this introductum history, a considerable
difference of style has been remarked. They differ in this
respect from each other, and from the usual style of Moses in
his subsequent writingS.

In the several portions of this primitive history, the same
events are recapitulated, to the same general effect, but with
new and peculial· circumstances. This is a thing not usual iu
the original and entire composition of one author. It has
rather the character ofa colleelion of docuinentS.

The several portions are also distinguished by such appro-
priate titles as, in any other volume of antiquity, would be ac-

knowledged to point out the beginning of detached compo-
sitions.

the cremon, and the institution of the sabbath.

Then follows another brief history of the creation, the
garden of Edcn and the fall of man, with an exordium which
intimates a distin& and independent composition. “ These are

the generations of the heaven and the earth,'' Sto. This book
concludes with chap. iii.

conversation of Eve with the serpent, it is Jehovah Elohim,
the Lord God, which is also repeated ΩΟ times.

In chap. iv, which contains the history os Cain and Abel,
