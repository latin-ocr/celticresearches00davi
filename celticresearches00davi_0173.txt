What we read of the ancient Germans sufficicntly proves,
111111 1116 art of personal aggrandizemcnt is not chimerical.

The hero may indeed have had motives, to determine him
in his choice, nearer home, than regard 10 1115 posterity. The
brave exertions of the IIeroine would bc of great weight 10
maim-din his cause 111 1116 6011115 of violence.

In societies 111115 constituted, the more feeblc of each sex
would be discarded as the dregs of 1116 people. No choico

Their language was 50 confounded that they could not under-

with those whose speech had not been confounded, nor with
such clans amongst 111611· late associatos, as had acquircd a

Sanchoniadron, speaking of those people who vvere dis-
persed from Babel, says,‚ “ These are the peoplc- who are
described as Exiles and lfamlcrcrs, and at the same time are

called the Titans.-Euseb. P. E. L. i.

Their real situation, aster the dispersion, appears 10 be de-
scribed in some passages of the book of J0b3 one of these I
