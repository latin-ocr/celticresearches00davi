But, isit must be insistcd upon, that a chain os communi-
cation united the Magi, Brachmans and 0111· Druids, it must,
I think, be a chain drawn through Asia Minor, and Thrace
or Macedon, the countries through which the Celtae came,
and in which tradition acknowledges theremains of their
family and religion.

The Druids are not represented as Inventors. They were
the J'ealous preservers of early and primitve disciphne, tradi·-
’ tions, doc-trinos, customs and opinions. Their method os ·
instruffion was by symbols and byenigmuS, or dark alleg01·ies’'“,
by ancient songs, and maxims orally delivered, and in
private3 but which they deemed it unlawful to reduce into
writing, 01· connnunicate out of their own pale†.

Of the lessons thus habitually, and by system, concealed,
few specimens are to be found in ancient authors. Mela,
L. iii. c. 2. has preserved one of them.

Unum ex iis quae praecipiunt in vulgus offluxit ς Videlicet-

“ Ut forent ad bella meliores 3
aeternas esse animas,
vitamque alteram ad manes.’'

One of their precepts has become public, namely, that
which bids them remember—

“ *to a& bravely in war3
that souls are immortal,
and there is another life after death.'’
