This has been a great question. Annongst some ancient and
modern nations, we find pielure writing, hieroglyphical re-
presentation& or else arbitrary signs of ideas, employed as
the general means of preserviug memorials. But whether any
of these are the remains of a primitive art, or the resources of
those societies which had forgotten the aecomplishments of

related exclusively to Amal-ek, it might be concluded that the
