In the same district which the Coram'cd first occupied,
we also find the Coecanau, one of whose principal towns is
called Llwyd Coit, οι· the fortress of the Cotti. This word,
with our Britz'slz article ys, forms Yscoit, οι· S’Coti. It may
not be easy to determine, with precision, the sense of
these very ancient names. Coranied may import Shepherds ,-
for Cor-lan is a skeepfold, and Cor-gi, a sheep dog, in*
Welslz, as Caor is a sheep, in Irislt.

Cawr is a giam, or mighty man: and Coetanau, or Cotti,
seems to be derived from Coet, W. Coat. Arm. and Cuit‚
Cornish, a forest or wood. The ancients describe a race of
Shephcrds, in primitive Europe-as Οἱαητε, who dweltin
thejbres. n mountains.

The country, which the Corauz‘ed occupied, is described,
as! having been, (Am), round the river Humber, and upon
the shore of Mo'r Tawclz, the German Ocean. In these
districts, their Britislz names are preserved, by the old Geo-
graphers, in the Cor-imni, Corii, Coitani, διο.

But, according to ancient Britz'sh accounts, their territory
enlarged itself, beyond the local application of these nameS,
and comprehended not only the inland regions, round the
wide-spreading arms of the H umber, but also much of the
Eastern coast of Englctnd. And I have reason to believe,
the account is just.

WVhen Coesar arrived in Britain, the Aborigines were
those of the interior parts, and of the W'estern coast. Their
character, and their habits were different from those of the
other Βνίῖοηε, with whom Caesar fought. We arc not ap·
