’ immediate obje& of the former was to prevent the execution
of a decree, which appears to have been published at the time
of the birth of Peleg, we may conclude that it took place soon
after that event. Nimrod might now be 60 or 65 years old,

May I offer a few remarks on this subjeft?

l. Down to the death of Noah, Moses regularly gives the
age of the father, at the birth of such a son, he adds the
remaining years of his lise, and then sums up the whole.—
The constant change of this enumeration cannot have hap-
pened through the mere inadvertency of transcribers. Some
wilsul and systematical corruption must be supposed, either in.
