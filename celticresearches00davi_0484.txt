The nouns of severallanguages are not declined at all.
The cases are distinguished by terms of known value. Verbs
are varied, in their moods‚ and their tenses, by auxiliaries,
and in their persons, by pronouns out of composition, whilst

the term, that simply describes the action, οι· state, remains·
unmoved.

Those prefixes, and final terminations, which abound in
some languageS, are, in many instances‚ evidcnt remains,
or corruptions, of distinct, and significant words, οι· terms.
Thus prefixes, and suffixes, which distinguish the persons, and
the tenses, ·of the Hebreze‘ verb, are acknowiedged to be
certain parts qs their primitive pronozcns.

Something of this kind, agreeabiy to the laws of general
grammar, must be supposed in all such instances. Men
could never have agreed to vary the known meaning of a
word, in a determinate, and regular manner, by adding to
it sounds, to which they attached no meaning at all.

Are we no‘t wan-anted in concluding, that 'the parcnt of
those languageS, which retain the characters here described,
was founded in afew simple terms, descriptivc either of lead-
ing ideas, or obvious perceptions, and so constructed, as to
serve the purposes, equally, of nouns, and verbs?

That -it made no variance of its nouns, and verbS, by the
help of unmeaning prcfixcs,-—of insei·tions,——and os tcr-
minations,but singly by the application of othei· tc1·1ns,which‚
however simple, had their known, and perceptiblc import.
