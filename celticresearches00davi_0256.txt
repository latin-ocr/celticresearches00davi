That part of the family which first came to Gaul and
Britain, in search of lasting possessions, probably withdrew
towards the Danube‚—-ascended even to the source of that
river‚—and stretched over to the Rhine ,- which river some of·
them perhaps may have crossed, whilst others followed thc
main stream, to its mouth, upon the German Ocean, or M6r

Pryclain, the son of Aedd the Great, a princc of thc chief
branch of the Celtae in the West.
