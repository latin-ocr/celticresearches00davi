But this does not militate against my first principle,
ἐκ-11101115, that we have an original propensis-z, bornwitlz
us, to expres& and communicate, certain, perceptions, or
ideas, by appropriate sounds s-—tlzczc suclzperceptimffi, and
sounds, leave, therefore, α natural relation between eacl‘c

other.

This propensity may have been guide enough to the un«³
cestors of the racc, in the formation of their simple voca*—
bulary; and that it wa5, in fact, I think, is demonstrable,

The operation of this principle is perceptible still, in the
simple, and primitive terms, of most languages3 and, as
far as we can ascertain the local inflections‚ combinations, in
contraction‚ we can, so far, trace its vestiges, into the
main body of languages.

The voice of nature has not been entirely silenced, or su:³
perseded, by imitative accomplishments, would Signor
Rossignol wish to communicate an idea, to his audience, he
would immediately, and at once, drop the language of the’
oziglctingale, or blaclcbird, and have recourse to that of the
society, in which he is placed. should he have broken
his fiddle, or torn his ruffle, he would, probably, discard
the foreign language, and would bewail his misfortune, in
his native dialect. Were the sanie person affected with
surprise, grossly affronted, or exposed, on a sudden, to
violent pain z—were the boy that prepares his neguS, to
have spilt some of the boiling water upon his foot, he would,
in a moment, quit the Italian, would forgct all his learn-
ing, and would express his agonics, in the language of na-
ture, that is, in such tones, interjections, or exclamations,
as would be equally understood, by the whole species
