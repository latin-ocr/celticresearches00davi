New objects, and their new circumstances, appeared.
These must have been described by new terms, and phrases,
or else, by new appropriations of old ones. The foundation
of dialeets was laid again.

The nations, by degrees, became settled in their peculiar-
dwellings, occupations‚ and habits of life. The objects,
which had been at first new, became familiar. The popu-
lar usageS, to which necessity, or accident, had given
birth, began to acquire prescriptive authority, in all corn-
munities, were to be regarded as the legitimate standards of
propriety, and were established by general rules. The lan-
guages acquired their discriminative character, and compa-
rative stability.

But still, they were nothing more than dialects of the mo·
ther tongue. There were local modes of oral delivery‚ ternis
of expression, combinations, and applications of terms; but
the fundamental principles were universal. Each colony
had planted its own slip of the parcnt trec, in its new pa·
trimony.

These offsets assumed, of course, different shapes, and
flourished, more, or less, according to the soil, the aspect,
climate, or skssl, of each plantor, and thc labour of his
cultivation. Some put forth more luxuriant branches than
others3 but the leaves, and fruit they bore, were still of the
same class, and specics.

Let us examine the natural characters of this plant, in
some of those peculiar specimens, which have neither

been pampered by excess of culture, nor starved b),-
extreme neglect.
