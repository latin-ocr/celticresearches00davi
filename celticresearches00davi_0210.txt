Under a variety of relative names and clim-affers, thcy
ackuowledged one God, the maker of all things, and the
Lord of the universe. They taught the superintendency of
Divino Providence—the immortality of the soni-moral re-
sponsibility, and recompence after death.

As a consequence of these principles, they observed, as
well as enjoined, the most rigid justice in their decisions‚ and
in their dealings with mankind&

Their pertrait, as sketched by ancient authors, has a
marked resemblance to that of other sacred orders, in the
most remote ages and countries.

Dr. Boi-lase demonstrates their general and close analogy to
the ,Magi of Persia. It almost constituted identity. They
scarcely differed in their name3 for Pliny calls the Druids the

Magi qf'tlte Gaul-5 aad B7·itons†.

The most able author of the Indian AntiquitieS, marks, with
deep and sound learning, the same affinity between the
Druids and Brut-lemnus of India. It may be extended to the
Clcaldecms, and the Orploez'e Priesthood of Thrace, as well as
to many others.

As this resemblance of chax-mer has been justly deemed
both too perfect and general, to be resolved into accidental
co-ineidcncc, it has been the ingenious labour of many learned
rnen, to ascertain the several meanS, by which the institutions,
opinions and eustolus of the Eastern world have been imported
into the l‘Vest of Europe.
