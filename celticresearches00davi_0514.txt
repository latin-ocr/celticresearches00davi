It has already been observed, that the primitive vowels
were strongly aspirated, aud that this aspiration‚ has adhered
so closely to the Hebrew vowels, as to occasion the mistake
of them for consonants: yet, I think, we can safely pro-
nounce Π to have been originally a symbol of the power,
Ε, He, οι· ΗέΙι. And the name it bears seems to imply,
that it was acknowledged to have the same general force, in
the structure of the oriental tongues, which it discovers, in
those of Europe.

ΠΠ Hetlz, terror, dread, aver-sion.
ΠΓΠ Hetlze, to take away, remove, burn, dissolve.
ΠΓιΠ ΗείΙιείΙι, to break,st·iglzten, discourage‚ descend.

And as the force of κ, in Heln-ew words, corresponds to
the import of its name, so does that of Π, in an eminent
and peculial· degree. As an initial, it is an absolute nega-
tive, or privative. It perverts the general import of the
elements, with which it is connected3 changes positive ideas
into negative, and negative into positive. l offer the follow-
