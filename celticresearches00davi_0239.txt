Asia, it was overshadowed by the darkness os the night, when
1110 morning arose upon the Enstern habitations of the
Noae-hidae: and the evening sun would appear to descend, in
its progress towards the western continent, as to a loa-cr sphere.
Hence 1110 portion of Japheth, or of Dis, obtained the
description of a lower Region—[lte land of Sltczdcs and (μί’

Such was the land of the Cimerii, the children of Dis.

It has frequentiy been remarked‚ that, in the general
‘mysticism of the Druids, and in many of their customs, there
is close analogy to those ‚of the Magi, the Brachmans, the
Egyptian Priests, Sto. I do not (1011)Υ the fizc‘i‘, but Ι conceive
that these traits of analogy were impressed upon mankind,
before the familie-s of the Earth were divided. And I cannot
but regret‚ that when pains 113νο been taken, and Fancy

bon-owed from the East, it has hardly been the object of a
moment's attention, amongst the learned, in this peculiat
class, to ascertaiu what those Europeans laad qftln‘ir own—a
Blany of the fundamental eustoms, and inveterate opinions
of the Celtae, appear to have been once universal. [would
not therefore, unless compelled by the unequivocal deeree os
historical proof, refer them to any particular source. And,
asto their general mysticism, I have quoted already a well
accredited fragment of Sanchoniathoib which contains the
elements of 311 the mystical theology in the ancient worlde«
It is there told us, 11131 1110 History, ZVtcology and Philosophy
of the first ages had been eonverted into mystie aliegories,
and this, at so early a period, that sciris, or BIizraim, 1110
Brother ‘of canaan, was amongst those who received them in
that form. The Patriarclzs of the other hadom, whether in
the East 01· in the Ises-t, had an eqnal opportunity of doing¹
1110 same.
