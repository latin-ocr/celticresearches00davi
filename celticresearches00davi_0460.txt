Virgil, and who did not, by the animated efforts of his
voice, mark himself a native critic.

He that has any taste for composition in his own tongue,
perceives the natural expression of sweetness, or asper-ily,
delicacy, or sublimity, in hearing a just recital of any verses,

§lost languages, indeed, ret-oin so much the exp1ession of

more effect, and propriety, than others3 we must infer,
that, in their own simple nature, they have some peculim,
and marked relation, to such ideas. This relation, being
founded in principles of nature, must have produced an
