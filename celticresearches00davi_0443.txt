expression, or tlzc relation between certain sozmcls, and

certain ideas.

IN the former essay, I gave my opinion, supported by
the evidence upon which it was formed, that an order known
by the name of Druids, to the latest period of their esta-
blishrnent, preserved a respectable copy of an alphabet‚
which the earliest of those tribes, which had settled in
Europe, brought with thern out of Asia. I also explained
the account, which those Draids left in Britain, respecting
the original, and fundamental principles of this alphabet.
I added, that a similar account is partly recognised by other
primitive nations.

But the importancc of the discovery is not limited only to
these facts. It acquires its principal value, from the
opportunity it affords, of illustrating an ancient system in
philology ε viz. That eaclz oftlze elementary soumls in lan-
guage, naturally describes α distinct image, or perception
oftlze mind, and that language was, originally, formed,
by following natm-e as tlte guide, in aslapting sounsls lilce
these, to their several, and respective occasions.

That such Druz'dical symbols,——and the series of letters,
which aroge from them ,—were intended, both to support that
systern,and explain its principles in detail,—appears, by the
following testimonies.
