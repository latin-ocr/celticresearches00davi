the substance, and to perccive a multitude of Gods, where
only the various relations and operations of one (iod, and tlie
phaenomena and changes of Nature, were originally intended.
All this is well aecounted sor by the grave historiari.

Long before the division of the nations, before Chna set-1
tled in Phoenicia or Thoth in Egypt, plain matter of fact had
been converted into mysterious Allegory, and sacred and
historical truth blended with the symbols of seasons, revolu-
tions of the heavenly bodies, and the like. This mystical

knowledge, and who most eriminally encouragcd popular
delusion (Tou τυῷον angen εκ παντως επινοοιψτες) studying above all

Notwithstanding these and similar blemishes, it may be
determined, upon the whole, that the descendants of Boah,
who first planted the nations, had been habituated to 1116
forms and institutions of soeial and cultivated life, and that
they carried with them, to their respecftive habitations, 11111011
valuable intbrmation, which they had therefore an opportu- .
nity of transmitting to, their. children.

It will be obser-ved that in many of the more distant nations,
the manual arts, and consequently, the convenieneies of
society were soon depressed‚ far below the standard 1 hare
laid down. This may very readily be accounted for. 1116-
chanism of all kinds depcnds much upon external means,
particularly upon the use of the harder metals.
