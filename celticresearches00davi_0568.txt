presses the same leading image, by a term of its own
vernacular dialect. Eut, as the several nations act upon
the same principle, this adjustment must have taken place,
not onl)⁷ when the reason for such an accurate, and clear
designationi was generally understood, but also, when the
separate families had the same imm-iable notice of that
reason.

4. Adue attention to the nature and meaning of the se-
veral names for each letter, and of the words connected
with them, will, I think, explain the reason for that pre—
cision which appears in the choice of those names; which
reason was this—In those primitive aget—3, it was aeknow-
ledged, as a fundamental principle, that each of the ele-
mentary sounds had a discriminate &tepor-t, andforce, in the
super-structure of language 3 and as the different languages
of the nations were, hitherto, regarded as dialeets of the
mother tongue, the sanie principle was admitted still.

5. My endeavours to ascertain this principle of natm-(tl
expression, may suffice to shew, in general, that there is a
relation between certain sounds, and certain ideas ofthings3
and may also induce a conclusion, that a choice os elemen-
tary powerS, in the formation of primitive ternis, was con-
foi-mablc· to the aclcnozcledgmcnt of this relation.

6. Is these premisses are granted, we may venture to
affirm, that, in the symbols, and the descriptive names of‘
elementary powers, we are still presented with an authentic-
system of the etymology, as well as grammar, which go·-
verned the most ancient, and primitive language of* tho
world.
