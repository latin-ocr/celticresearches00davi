aspirate H .· at present, they hardly know what is meant
by it.

Thus HA, Ηέ, ΗΞ, Hb, Ha, became ᾶ, ἒ, ἲ, ὂ, ἀ,- but
this change occasioned little, or no confusion in language.
The vowels retained their essential powers, in utter-
ance, and their proper symbols in orthography.

Other innovations were gradually introduced, which ren·
dcred the natural expression of the vocal sound less per-
ceptible. The general progress from energy to delieaey,
and from the latter to indolence, in place of the primi-
tive open A, {ubstitutcd the power of the slender English A.

This power, the ancient Hebrews, perhap5, represented
by ,Ἲς but, as in most alphabets, it wants an appropriate
character, it has been generally represented by E. Thus,
in Latin, Ago fiorms Egi, and several eompounds change
A into E. The same change regularly takes place in the

Welslz language.

E was also reduced, occasionally, to the more delicate
and slender sound of I, (ec.) Hence, the Latin verbs,
Egeo, Teneo, Emo, διο. in their compoundS, regularly
take I, in the place of E. And, as A was mutable into
E, and E into I, so the power of the first of these vowels
was reduced frequently to that of I. In Latin, there
are not fewer than about twenty simple verbs, which as
often as they are compounded‚ regularly change A into I.

I, as ec, being, in its own nature, the most slender sound
we can utter, has retained its place, ant* its power, more
generally than the others.
