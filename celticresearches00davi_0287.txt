The apple-trees and ιψεῖῖοῑυ apples of Merddin's garden,
that were given to him by his Lord, Gwenddoleu ab
Ccidio, the master qf'tlzefair bow, the son qureservatimz,
arc famous in Britz'sh Elch‘lzolog . In the W. Arclz. V. l.
P. 150, there is 3 mystica] poem, given under the character,
of Mer-ddja, from which it appears, that, by these trees,
and their fruit, the whole system of Druidical divination
was implied and covered. The first pennill runs thus.

“ To no one has been shown, in one season of twilight
What sslerddin received before he became old,

‘Seven fair apple-treeS, and seven score, ⁸

Of equal age, equal height, length, and size:

One maid, with crisped locks, guards them—-

Olet-*edd is her name-of the form of light are her teeth.’'

Οἷα, Gla-emor Olzcedd is Verum„ Were not those trees,
constellations, and may not the apples have been stars, which
after they were committed into the charge of the most pre-
emincnt in the order, could be discovered by none till
Merdclin, or Hesperus appeared?

From hence it should seem, asif the ὲιζοῖἅεη apples, which
IIercules procured from the garden of the Hesperides,
pointed 31 the science of astronomica] divination.

The guard of Plnro’s-gate, or three hender] Cerberus,
may signify the mystical doctrines of the Hyperboreans‚
guarded by their three orders—their Druid, their Bard,
and their Ozydrl. And what renders this, not a little pro-
1131116 is, that Rem, 01· Kclv, in many ancient languages,
means a dog, and 11131, in Britislz, the same word im>-
ports a mys-story or scicnce. ”
