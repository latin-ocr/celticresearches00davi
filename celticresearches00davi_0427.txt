principles, upon which it was constrlrcted, were known in
primitive ages, before the nations were separated.

It must, then, be inferred, that such principles were

and the Pleoenicians. As far as any thing can be demon-
strated, by the terius, and metaphors of language, the fact
has been ascertained.

May Ι, therefore, hope to be indulged, in a short search,
after some links of original union, between the Euo-opem»
alphabets, and these of the western Asiatic [2

· But first, I would observe, that long before the date of
any legible inscription, which has reached our age, the
Asiatics had begun to enlarge the range of the fancy, to
improve, or diversify the arts, and materiallyto extend the
limits of seienec. ’

The paintings of their figurative language had also ac-

could never have attained.

As a necessary consequence of this, it might be expected,
that our oldest copies of their alphabets would be
more copious, in the number of their letters, and more
complex in their principles, than alphabetS, traced from
our more simple ancestors.

Accordingly, wc fmd the Hebrew alphabet, in the time
of Moses, already possessed of twenty-two powerS, when
the Europcan, for a long time after, had but sixteen, at,
the most, and, pei-liaps,‘only thirteen.
