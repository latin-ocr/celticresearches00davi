“ The King of Babylon stood—to use divinati0n3 he
made his arrows bright‚· he consulted with images; ha
looked in the liverst' Ezek. xxi. 21. On this passage,
J erom observes, that there was a method of divirzatz'orz, by
marking, or inscribing arrows, with every one's name, and
mixing them in the quiver, to see whose arrow would come
out first, or what city should be first attaeked. To this
fallacious decision, the prophet alludes, in the 13th verse
of the same chapte1·:-—“ Because it is a trial: and what if¹
the sword contemn even the rod {2³²

This inscription of rods appears to have been a refinement
upon the earliest, or primitive custorn‚ and seems to have
been introduced, when the symbolical species could not bc
readily obtained. But the custom was not modern 3 it was
known to the Israelites in the days of Moses, and, perhaps,
long before. “ Speak unto the children of Israel, and take
of every one of them a rod, according to the house of their
fathers, of all the princes, according to the house of their
fathers, twelve rods: write thou every man’s name upon
his rod.'' These were laid up for the decision of an im-
portant question. They were not, in this instance, drawn
as lots,—for the Lord vhimself decided by a miracle. But
the general practice appears to have been adopted fa-
miliarly, in cases of decision, or in the assignment of por-
tions by lot. Hence rod, lot, portion, or intret-itance, aro
used for synonymous terius.

chased of old; the rod of thine inker-itance which thou
