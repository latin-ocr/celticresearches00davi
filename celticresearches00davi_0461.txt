date the sound, and the sense.

Τ hat Imay not insist, at present, upon the vocal soumis,
which are supposed, in general, to have obvious connection
with tones of the voices—we may convince ourselves, by
experiment, of the accuracy that is to be found in this de-
duction, as it respects the powers of the consonants. Cer-
tuin actions will be found, of course, co generate, εροηία-

So, in hugging a substance within the arms, and, as it
