have several reasons to believe. We find traditions in many
connum, that certain mountains, rivers, and even cities had
survived the deiuge, or, at least, that new cities were built
upon the site of the old ones, and retained their names. Wlfhat·
ever eredit may be given to the particulars of such traditions,
their whole sum, and their great geographical extent, suffi-
ciemly declare the general opinion of antiquity upon this
subjecl3 and it is a subject, upon which it may be supposed,
that some historical truth survived.

Moses describes the branchos of the river of ’ Eden, which
had existed from the Creati0n‚ by their names and courses,
as known in his own time. No circumstance could possibly
have constituted the identity of these rivers, but the identity
of the country through which they flowed. It is evident then
that the part of the old continent which formed the cradle of
the human race, and the centre of antediluvian population,
survived the deluge. Why should we think otherwise of those
remote regions, which must have been less obnoxious to the
Divine displeasure?

It appears that even the trees were not wholly eradicated,
that their vegetativc power wasnot destroyed, and that the
produftions of the earth were not re-created‚ but gradually
recovered. For no sooner had the waters left the surface of
the ground than the olive-trees began to put forth leax es,
“ And the dove came to Noah in the Evening‚ and lo! in her
mouth was an olive leaf plztcked qff.'' It must have been a
leaf in full vegetation, otherwise it could not have been dis-
tinguished from the leaf of a branch which had floated upon
the waterS. But though the dove found dry land, and trees
producing leaves, she found as yet no proper sustenance, and
therefore was compelled to return—-a necessity to which she

was not reduced at her next visit, when vegetation was further
advanced.
