The old pocts and historiam, upon almost every occasion,
shew a [1101)611511)7 10 espousc the opposite party. “The poenis
of the Greeks, their poetic 1115101165, the Eddas of the (ionis,
the legends of Persia and India, the tmditions of the Britons,
and even 'the tales of the Grcenhindcrs describe these giants 5ο
much mike, that it is evident they 1111 drew from one original,
and that their strokes are copied froin nature.

This remarkabie concurrencc of evidence, from times and
places 50 16111016 from each other, carries 1111 1116 force of 1111111.
Universa} tradition must be referred to some universal circum-
stance or event. And the traditions respeeting the deiuge arc
not more uniform or more general, than those which regard
1116 giantS. All ancient 1111110115 acknovaedge their acquain-
tance with such a 11166. They intrnded into the 16665565 of
their country, they lurked amongst their caves, their 1016515,
their rocks and their desolate Ρ111665, praetising sorcery and
diabolical 11115, exercising all manner of violence, and so 116166
and savage, that it was a matter of indifference ter them
whether they feastcd upon a sheep or a 1111111. But I know of
no 111111011 which 11011515 of 1116111 115 115 11116651015.

This is a general feature in ancient tradition, and worthy of
remark. All people claim the family 111111 was preserved at
the deiuge 115 their own peculim· ancest01·S, and 1116 founders
of their nati0n3 but the giants are always detested strangers,
with whom they never chose to have any connection. 501116
Greek writer indeed makes Orpheus the Thracian call them
Ημιετεξων ωξογονοι vom-egeam but it is probable the Thracian himself
would have been more shy of his 11116651015.

The Greeks, in like manner, compliment the Celtae with
their descent from the giants; but the Celtae themselves,
while they ackuowledge that such a race dwelt amongst them,
