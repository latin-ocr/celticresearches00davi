tongue is, compared with oui-sc But language could not'
long have been confincd within such narrow limits. Being
once put in motion, its use, and properties once under-2
stood, it easily kept pace with socia] progreSS.

The intellectual exertions of the first ages, were both
rapid, and various. And, as no society of men has been
found in the possession of knowledge, without adequate
means for its mutual communication, we may conclude,
that primitiVe language soon became rich, and compre-
hensive.

It may be further observed, that men soon divided into
distinct societies, in which they pursued various occupa-
tions‚ and acquired various branches of knowledge. They
had, consequently, various occasions to call forth oral
powers. These must have produced local ternis, local
idioms, and local acceptations of common termS. Various
dialects must, therefore, have existed before the flood.

One alone of these was preserved, by the single house,
or tribe, that survived the catastrophe: the whole earth was
again of one language, and of one speech, whilst its in-
habitants formed but one society. But, no sooner were they
separated from each other, and placed under a variety of
local circumstances, than the sanie causes, vfhich had ope-
rated before, and which mustalwhys operate, began to ge-
nerate similar effects.

WVithout calling before us, the miraculous confusion which
affected great part of the human species, it is obvious that-
some changes, from the universal root, must havepresented

themselves immediately upon the division of the families.
