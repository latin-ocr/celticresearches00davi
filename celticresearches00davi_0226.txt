’ sallon in a political and great conflitst, which had arisel] in
their te1·ritories²*. From thence, and flying from the Scythians
into Asia, the survivors took their course- to the Cimmerian
BosplwruS.

We have but little account of the state of this people as a
society, but the defence of· their country by walls, or a chain
of ramparts, points them out as a race, comparatively
civilized, and'assiduousl y culti-vating the arts of peace.

The time they were dispossessed by the Scythians may be
ascertained. A braneh of this people who had occupied the
Southern shore of the Caspian sea, being harassed by the
Massa-Getae, retired across the Araxes and penetratetl into
the country of their European brethren. Upon the irrup-
tion of this multitude, the Cimmerii were thrown into con-
sternation. Their princes took up arms to defend their
country3 but the populace, who, perhaps, were held in the
same estiination as in Gaul, thought it a country not wouh a
contest, and formed the resolution to emigrate. The debates
in their councils ended in a battle, and the Cimmerii were-
either beaten by the Scythae, or, as Herodotus relates it„ their
prince5‚ and multitudes of their people fell by mutual wounds.
The survivors, having buricd their dead, on the banks of the
Tyra, took their ssight over the Ci111n1e1·ian Bosphorus into
Asia, and the Scythae took possession of the territories that
were thus deserted. Unwilling, however, to part with so
many vassals, they pursued the fugitives, but mistaking their

way, they left Mount Caucasus upon the right, and, by a ·

circuitous course, penetrated into Media. Falling upon the
army of Dcioces, King of the Medes, they obtained a complete
victory orer him, and their ¹<poll was the Sovereignty of Asia,
which they held for twenty-eight years.
